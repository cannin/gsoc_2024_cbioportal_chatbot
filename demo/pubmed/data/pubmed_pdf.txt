Cavenee, December 15, 2014 (sent for review November 20, 2014)\\nGastric cancer (GC) is a highly heterogeneous disease. To identify\\npotential clinically actionable therapeutic targets that may inform\\nindividualized treatment strategies, we performed whole-exome\\nsequencing on 78 GCs of differing histologies and anatomic lo-\\ncations, as well as whole-genome sequencing on two GC cases,\\neach with three primary tumors and two matching lymph node\\nmetastases. The data showed two distinct GC subtypes with either\\nhigh-clonality (HiC) or low-clonality (LoC). The HiC subtype of\\nintratumoral heterogeneity was associated with older age, TP53\\n(tumor protein P53) mutation, enriched C > G transition, and sig-\\nnificantly shorter survival, whereas the LoC subtype was associ-\\nated with younger age, ARID1A (AT rich interactive domain 1A)\\nmutation, and significantly longer survival. Phylogenetic tree anal-\\nysis of whole-genome sequencing data from multiple samples of\\ntwo patients supported the clonal evolution of GC metastasis and\\nrevealed the accumulation of genetic defects that necessitate com-\\nbination therapeutics. The most recurrently mutated genes, which\\nwere validated in a separate cohort of 216 cases by targeted se-\\nquencing, were members of the homologous recombination DNA\\nrepair, Wnt, and PI3K-ERBB pathways. Notably, the drugable NRG1\\n(neuregulin-1) and ERBB4 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia\\nviral oncogene homolog 4) ligand-receptor pair were mutated in 10%\\nof GC cases. Mutations of the BRCA2 (breast cancer 2, early onset)\\ngene, found in 8% of our cohort and validated in The Cancer Genome\\nAtlas GC cohort, were associated with significantly longer survivals.\\nThese data define distinct clinicogenetic forms of GC in the Chinese\\npopulation that are characterized by specific mutation sets that can\\nbe investigated for efficacy of single and combination therapies.\\nclonality | exome sequencing | mutation | ERBB | BRCA2\\nG\\nastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cancer and\\nthe second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, ac-\\ncounting for 8% of all newly diagnosed cancers and 10% of\\ncancer mortality(1). Environmental risk factors for GC include\\na high-salt diet, smoking, and infectious agents (1), including the\\nbacterium Helicobacter pylori (2), and Epstein Barr Virus (3).\\nConsistent with its complicated etiology (e.g., diet) and ana-\\ntomical environment, GC is clinically and pathologically highly\\nheterogeneous (4), with a large variation in 5-y survival rates in\\ndifferent countries, and even different cities in the same country\\n(5, 6). This clinical heterogeneity is mirrored by concomitant\\nheterogeneous molecular signatures in GC mRNA, protein, and\\nmiRNA expression profiles (7, 8). Standard treatment strategies\\nhave largely ignored the heterogeneity and individuality of dif-\\nferent subtypes of GC. The current approach entails surgical\\nremoval of the tumor followed by adjuvant fluoropyrimidine,\\ntaxane, and platinum-based chemotherapy doublets or triplets,\\nespecially for advanced GC, and this is exacerbated by the lack of\\nreliable markers to predict response. Recently, the US Food and\\nDrug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have\\napproved Trastuzumab for patients with HER2-overexpressing\\nmetastatic GC, which represent less than 15% of the disease pop-\\nulation. The high incidence of GC in Asian countries and its in-\\ncreasing incidence in Western countries point to a clear need for\\ndeveloping more effective therapies for GC as well as the dis-\\ncovery of markers that predict their therapeutic response.\\nGenome sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to identify\\npotential driving oncogenic targets for therapeutic intervention.\\nWang et al. sequenced 22 samples from Hong Kong GC patients\\nand identified mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification\\nSignificance\\nWe have identified a lethal subtype of gastric cancer (GC) that is\\ncharacterized by high levels of clonal heterogeneity and TP53\\n(tumor protein P53) mutation. We have also uncovered key\\nnovel mutations in the targetable NRG1 (neuregulin-1) and\\nERBB4 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene\\nhomolog 4) ligand-receptor pair and identified BRCA2 (breast\\ncancer 2, early onset) mutations as new genetic markers to predict\\nbetter survival for GC.

Two recent and more comprehensive geno-\\nmic characterizations of Russian and Hong Kong GC by the The\\nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Wang et al.

Germ-line DNA was\\navailable from matching blood samples and used as a sequence\\nreference to detect somatic alterations. All patients signed in-\\nformed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the\\nInstitutional Review Board from Tianjin Medical University\\nCancer Institute and Hospital. We performed whole-exome se-\\nquencing (WES) on 78 samples (discovery cohort) and WGS on\\ntwo cases with three primary tumors and two matching lymph\\nnode metastases. Novel recurrently mutated genes were further\\nvalidated in a separate cohort of 216 cases from the same pop-\\nulation (validation cohort) by targeted sequencing using the Ion\\nTorrent PGM platform. Primary tumors were from the following\\nanatomic locations within the stomach: 64 from the antrum\\n(21.77%), 118 from the body (40.14%), and 112 from the cardia\\n(38.10%). All histopathologic diagnoses were subjected to in-\\ndependent review by at least two senior pathologists, and in this\\nstudy cases with discrepant diagnosis among pathologists (five cases,\\n1.70%) were not included. In this study, 124 cases were classified as\\nintestinal-type, 152 as diffuse-type, and 18 of mixed intestinal and\\ndiffuse histology. Clinical stage was determined according to Na-\\ntional Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Among the 294\\nsamples, 6 (2.05%) were stage I, 85 (28.91%) were stage II, 97\\n(32.99%) were stage III, and 106 (36.05%) were stage IV. At the\\ntime of this report, clinical follow-up data were complete for 284\\nparticipants, with 13.84 months of median follow-up, 25.08 months\\nfor the WES series (32 deceased, 41.03%), and 12.16 months for\\nthose with targeted sequencing (61 deceased, 28.24%) (Dataset S1).\\nIdentification of High Clonality and Low Clonality Subtypes in GC by\\nClonality '), Document(page_content="Analysis. The 78 GC samples in discovery panel and their\\nmatching blood cells were subjected to WES. A mean coverage\\ndepth of 167X was achieved for GC tumor DNA, and 170X for\\nmatched normal blood cells. Eighty-five percent of exons were\\ncovered at 20X or greater depth for both tumor and normal\\nsamples (Fig. S1 and Dataset S2). We applied MuTect (13) and\\nVarScan2.2.5 (14) to whole-exome data to detect somatic point\\nand indel mutations. A total of 13,866 mutations were detected\\nin this cohort, including 3,421 synonymous, 8,558 missense, 576\\nnonsense, 241 splice site, 967 frameshift, and 103 nonframeshift\\nindels. The overall mutation frequency was 112.5 mutations (range\\nof 1–1,486 mutations) with a median of 82.5 for nonsilent muta-\\ntions per tumor (Dataset S3).\\nTo gain insight into GC heterogeneity, we performed SNV\\nclonality analysis using a recently reported algorithm SciClone\\n(15), which estimates the clusters of clones in each sample. This\\nanalysis identified cluster numbers ranging from 1 to 8 in our\\ncohort with a bimodal distribution dipping at a cluster number of\\n4. We thus define those GC cases with cluster numbers larger\\nthan 4 as high clonal or HiC (nine cases) (Fig. 1A and Dataset\\nS4) and cases with cluster numbers equal to or fewer than 4 as\\nlow clonal or LoC (68 cases) (Fig. 1B and Dataset S4). Associ-\\nation analyses with clinical parameters revealed that the HiC\\nsubtype was associated with older disease onset age (Fig. 1C)\\n(Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.27, P = 0.02). There were\\na total of 11,768 protein-coding subclonal SNVs (92.3% of all\\ndetected mutations, with a median of 106 mutations per sample)\\n(Dataset S3). Gene-level mutation analysis revealed that the HiC\\nsubtype had a significantly higher frequency of TP53 mutations\\n(Fig. 1D), whereas the LoC subtype was enriched for ARID1A\\nmutations (Fig. 1E), both thought to be the driving events in GC\\ntumorigenesis. Previous studies of leukemia (16) have reported\\nthat the higher clonal complexity was associated with poor sur-\\nvival, likely because of chemoresistance. Among our cohort of 78\\nGC patients, 32 (41.03%) died from GC with a median follow-up\\nof 25.1 months (range from 0.20 to 78.95 months) (Dataset S1).\\nSurvival analysis showed that the HiC subtype was significantly\\nassociated with shorter survival compared with the LoC subtype\\n(P = 0.02, log-rank test) (Fig. 1F). There were no significant\\ndifferences in the treatment regimens between the HiC and LoC\\nsubtypes. This association remained significant after adjusting\\nfor age, sex, stage, Lauren subtype, TP53 mutation, and ARID1A\\nmutation [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 4.69; 95% confidence\\ninterval (CI), 1.62–13.6; P = 0.0043], indicating that the clonal\\nsubtype is an independent prognostic factor for GC.\\nThe distinct clinical behavior of the HiC and LoC subtypes\\nsuggest they may have fundamental differences in tumorigenesis,\\nas was recently proposed to be manifested by various nucleotide\\nlevel mutational signatures (17, 18). Detailed mutational signa-\\nture analysis of these two subtypes showed a significant difference\\nin the percentages of C-to-G transition and C-to-T transversion\\nmutations. HiC GCs had a significantly smaller fraction of C-to-T\\ntransversion mutation (45% in HiC vs. 52% in LoC) but greater\\nfraction of C-to-G transition mutation (25% in HiC vs. 9% in\\nLoC, P = 0.002). Specifically, the HiC subtype had a significantly\\nhigher fraction of C > G mutation in almost all contexts, except\\nfor the G in the 5′-adjacent to C (Dataset S4 A–C).\\nAlthough TP53 mutations were commonly found in the HiC\\ngroup, they were present only in the minor clones (mutation\\nfrequency < 15%) in all six positive HiC cases (Dataset S4 D and\\nE). Conceivably, any of the minor clones can become a major\\nclone after a single agent therapy, which has been illustrated in a\\nstudy in leukemia (16). Thus, in principle, all of the subclones in\\na tumor should be eliminated for curative therapy. We used a\\ndrug–gene interaction database, DGIdb (19), to search for dru-\\ngable targets for the clones present in the HiC tumors (Dataset\\nS4F). As expected, many gene mutations and the clones har-\\nboring them do not have corresponding drugs available. How-\\never, for tumors like PGM71 and PGM32, targetable mutations\\nwere identified for almost all subclones [e.g., ALK, ABL2,\\nSMAD4 (SMAD family member 4), FANCG, NRG1, KRAS\\n(Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), and others]\\n1108\\n|\\nwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1422640112\\nChen et al.\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC4313862', 'name': 'Gastric Adenocarcinoma (TMUCIH, PNAS 2015)', 'description': 'Whole-exome sequencing of 78 Gastric Adenocarcinomas and their matched normal samples.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '25583476', 'citation': 'Chen et al.

In these cases, combination chemo- and targeted\\ntherapies might be much more effective than those using single\\nagents. For other HiC cases the targetable mutations were ob-\\nserved in only two or three clones, underscoring the need for\\ndrug development strategies that test multiple combinations\\n(Dataset S4H).\\nClonal Evolution of GC During Metastasis. To define the type and\\nextent of intratumoral heterogeneity as GC progresses to me-\\ntastasis, we performed WGS of two cases (Pt1 and Pt2) where,\\nfor each case, we obtained the information by dissection and\\nanatomical mapping of three different areas of primary tumor\\nand two lymph node metastases. Pt1 had a total of 4,082 nonsilent\\nmutations, including 2,809 missense, 143 nonsense, 132 splice\\nsite, 958 frameshift, and 40 in-frame indels. Pt2 had a lower\\nmutation rate with 287 nonsilent mutations (253 missense, 14\\nnonsense, 10 splice site, 3 frameshift, and 7 in-frame). Consistent\\nwith the higher mutation rate in Pt1, mutations were found in\\nseveral DNA-mismatch repair and chromatin remodeling genes,\\nincluding MSH6, TGFBR2, KDM5A, and MLL4. In Pt2, the\\nSETBP1 gene (p.S944N) was mutated, as it is in myeloid malig-\\nnancies (20), together with amplification of AKAP9 and CDK6\\n(cyclin-dependent kinase 6). Intriguingly, mutations of the gene\\nencoding the voltage-dependent calcium channel protein, CAC-\\nNA1D p.V529G, was found in both Pt1 and Pt2. Copy number\\nalteration analysis showed that a large proportion of the genome\\nwas altered in both Pt1 and Pt2, accounting for 516.6 Mb and\\n706.8 Mb, respectively. Pt2 exhibited consistent genomic am-\\nplification of 7q21.2–7q21.3, and Pt1 had amplifications across\\nchr7 and chr8. Pt1 and Pt2 had a comparable number of struc-\\ntural variations with 3,812 and 3,390 breakpoints, respectively.\\nBecause clonal evolution is closely linked to cancer metastasis,\\nwe applied phylogenetic tree analysis (SI Methods) to the five\\nsamples for each GC case and observed considerable divergence\\namong the three primary tumor samples in each (Fig. 2 and Fig.\\nS2). Interestingly, only one part of the primary tumor was closely\\nrelated to the two highly similar lymph-node metastases, sug-\\ngesting they were derived from a common clonal ancestor. The\\nmultiple clones uncovered within primary tumor and lymph-node\\nmetastases suggests the necessity of combined therapy that tar-\\ngets different genetic changes found within the patient’s com-\\nbined tumor burden. We therefore used DGIdb (19) to search\\nfor potentially drugable targets in different parts of the same\\ntumor and their resultant metastases. "), Document(page_content="Results of the drug–sample\\ninteraction analysis suggest that Pt1 might benefit from combined\\ntargeting of PI3K, CDK7, and Notch (as well as immunotherapy)\\n(Fig. 2), whereas combined AURKC and CDK6 inhibitors might\\nbenefit Pt2 (Fig. S2).\\nValidated NRGs-ERBBs Mutations in GC. Among the total of 13,866\\nmutations, we also sought to identify clinically actionable\\nmutations in GC.

Intriguingly, none of these gene mutations were observed\\nto significantly associate with same anatomical location in TCGA\\ndata, suggesting different genetic background (Russian vs. Chi-\\nnese) or even diets might contribute to the mutation distribution.\\nIn addition to anatomical location, we also interrogated the as-\\nsociation between gene mutation and Lauren subtypes of GC.\\nWe found that CDH1 somatic mutations (21 of 294 cases, 7.1%)\\nwere strongly enriched in the diffuse GC (Fig. S6A) and 8 of\\nthese 21 somatic CDH1 mutations were loss-of-function types\\n(e.g., nonsense and frameshift mutations). RHOA mutations\\nwere also enriched in diffuse GC, consistent with recent reports\\n(11, 12). Interestingly, Wnt pathway mutations showed a moderate\\nenrichment among intestinal GC. Survival analysis showed\\nthat the CDH1-mutated GCs had shorter survival, whereas\\nWnt pathway mutated GCs had longer survival (log-rank P =\\n0.04) (Fig. S6B). This difference was not a result of their as-\\nsociation with the two Lauren classifications because we did\\nnot observe significantly different survival of these latter two\\ngroups in our cohort. Interestingly, RHOA-mutated cases were not\\nassociated with shorter survivals similar to CDH1-mutated GCs,\\nsuggesting RHOA driven and CDH1 driven diffuse GCs are dif-\\nferent clinically.\\nAlthough ERBB2 has been previously recognized as a thera-\\npeutic target for GC because of its gene amplification and mu-\\ntation (confirmed in our study), our analysis revealed that\\nanother member of the ERBB pathway, ERBB4, was significantly\\nmutated in both our discovery and validation cohorts. Mutation of\\nERBB4 or HER4 has recently been shown to be an oncogenic\\ndriver in melanoma (21), although this has not been previously\\ndescribed for GC. Mutated ERBB4 activates both ERBB4 and\\nPI3K-AKT signal transduction and can be inhibited by the dual-\\ntyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib, for which efficacy is presently\\nbeing evaluated in phase III clinical trials in ERBB4-mutated\\nmelanoma (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01264081). In our dis-\\ncovery cohort, ERBB4 was mutated in seven samples. In the\\nvalidation cohort, another 13 samples had ERBB4 mutations.\\nAmong these mutations, ERBB4 p.R50C, was also observed in\\nmelanoma (Fig. 3A). Unlike ERBB2, which has no known ligand,\\nERBB4 binds to NRGs, particularly NRG1, forming homo- and\\nheterodimers, and leading to the subsequent activation of kinase\\nactivity. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of NRG1\\nleads to the activation of ERBBs and consequent Lapatinib-\\nsensitivity (22). However, no somatic mutation of NRG1 has\\nbeen reported previously. In our discovery cohort, NRG1 was\\nmutated in five samples. In the validation cohort, NRG1 muta-\\ntions were observed in another 16 cases. Taking these data to-\\ngether, we find that NRG1 and ERBB4 were mutated in 34 GC\\nsamples (11.6%), with 3 samples having mutations in both genes\\nand 31 samples having mutations in either NRG1 or ERBB4 (Fig.\\n3). Detailed analysis showed that 7 of 21 (33%) ERBB4 muta-\\ntions occurred in the kinase domain and 4 (20%) in the receptor\\ndomains, suggesting these mutations might impact receptor\\nligand interaction and kinase activity. Interrogation of the 289 GC\\ncases in the TCGA database also revealed ERBB4 mutations\\npresent in both the receptor domain (i.e., p.R106H/C) and the\\nkinase domain (i.e., p.V744L and p.774N/G).

Ad-\\njuvant chemotherapy as the standard of care for GC has limited\\nsuccess and there is no reliable marker to predict response.\\nAmong our 78 WES cohort of GC cases, 5 had BRCA2 mutations\\n(interestingly, there were no BRCA1 mutations). Correspond-\\ningly, in the 216 targeted sequencing cohort cases, another 12 had\\nBRCA2 mutations (10 somatic and 2 germ line) (Dataset S3 and\\nS5). A higher frequency (28 of 289 cases) of BRCA2 mutations\\nwas also found in the TCGA Russian GC cohort (Fig. 4A). This\\nfinding is consistent with epidemiological studies showing that\\nGC is the third major cancer type, joining breast and ovarian\\ncancer, with BRCA2 mutations (23). We hypothesized that the\\nBRCA2 mutation might be clinically important for GC because\\nof accumulating evidence demonstrates that such mutations are\\nassociated with improved response to platinum-based chemo-\\ntherapy and longer survival in ovarian cancer (24). BRCA2 mu-\\ntant carrier patients are marginally correlated with longer survival\\nin Tianjin cohort (P = 0.07, HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.07–1.19). A\\nsimilar nonsignificant trend was also observed in TCGA cohort\\n(P = 0.23, HR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.10–1.77). When these two cohorts\\nwere pooled to increase the sample size to 569 (and BRCA2 mu-\\ntation carriers to 45 cases), mutation carriers were significantly\\ncorrelated with longer survival (log-rank P = 0.03) (Fig. 4B). After\\nadjusting for age, stage, and different population, BRCA2 mutation\\nremained a significant factor predicting longer survival (P = 0.05,\\nHR= 0.37, 95% CI: 0.13–0.96) (Fig. 4C).\\nConclusion and "), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nThe most important finding to emerge from this study is the\\ndescription of intratumoral heterogeneity, which was revealed by\\nclonality analysis. The observation that mutational signatures of\\ntwo subtypes of GC are distinct from each other indicates there\\nmight be fundamental difference in etiology (such as mutagens)\\nof two subtypes, which cause different mutational patterns. The\\nGCs with the highest heterogeneity, which we termed the HiC\\nsubtype, have the poorest survival. This result could be because\\nof the escape of specific subclones from the therapeutic effect of\\nsingle agents. Gene-level analysis further identified TP53 and\\nARID1A mutation as markers for HiC and LoC, respectively,\\nwhich may have translational significance in clinic, although this\\nwill need to be validated in the future.\\nTumor heterogeneity is clearly a hallmark for metastatic\\ntumors, a notion supported by our phylogenic tree analysis of\\nWGS data from two metastatic GC cases where we were able to\\nanalyze multiple samples. Metastasis can be challenging to treat\\nbecause metastatic cells can be quite different from those of their\\nprimary tumors. The drug target analysis of the heterogeneous\\nclones suggested that specific clones have differing drugable\\ngene mutations, yet whether all would need to be targeted for\\neffective therapy remains to be determined. It is plausible that\\ncombination therapy that targets driver mutations in all of the\\nkey clones within a tumor, potentially combined with immuno-\\ntherapeutic approaches, might be an effective approach to treat\\na heterogeneous cancer like GC.\\nThe present study of Chinese GC identified a number of com-\\nmonly mutated genes that have been reported in other populations\\n(Hong Kong and Russian) including TP53, ARID1A, CDH1, APC,\\nRHOA, PIK3CA, SMAD4, MYC, and KRAS. Our study also\\nrevealed some mutation events that were not reported previously.\\nNotably, the NGR1 and ERBB4 genes were commonly mutated in\\nour cohort. Whether this is more specific to the Chinese population\\ncompared with others remains to be replicated. However, this\\nfinding is of potential significance because inhibitors for ERBB\\nsignaling are available and in clinical trials.

Although several factors likely play a role, the\\ncontribution of potential differences in tumor genetics to this\\ndisparity have yet to be fully explored (1, 3). In particular, AA\\nCRCs were notably underrepresented in the four major pub-\\nlished CRC sequencing studies (4–7), accounting for only two\\nannotated AA cases of the 333 total CRCs studied (4–7). Accord-\\ningly, we initiated this study to compare the mutational landscapes\\nof CRCs from AA individuals versus Caucasians.\\n"), Document(page_content="Results\\nUsing whole-exome DNA sequencing, we examined a discovery\\nset of 31 microsatellite stable (MSS) late-stage AA CRCs (Dataset\\nS1, Tables S1 and S2). Somatic mutations were detected using two\\nvariant calling algorithms for the point mutations and indels (8–\\n10). One sample, 3213, identified as hypermutated, was excluded\\nfrom subsequent analyses (Fig. S1 and Dataset S1, Table S1). In\\na second sample, 11481, library preparation from the normal tissue\\nfailed. Among the 29 informative AA CRCs, we found 2,696\\nprotein-altering mutations in 2,156 genes (Dataset S1, Table S3).\\nAs expected for CRCs (6, 11), the mutational spectra of these 29\\nAA CRCs revealed C > T transitions as the predominant base\\nsubstitution (Fig. S2 and Dataset S1, Table S4).\\nWe next asked whether this discovery cohort of AA CRCs\\nidentified recurrent somatic mutations in any new genes not pre-\\nviously identified in CRCs (4, 6, 7). In the discovery AA CRCs, 385\\ngenes demonstrated nonsilent mutations in at least two cancers.\\nFor 78 of these genes, we found that no protein-altering mutations\\nhad been previously reported among MSS nonhypermutator\\nCRCs characterized in prior large-scale sequencing studies of\\nCRCs (4, 6, 7) (Dataset S1, Table S5). We designed an Agilent\\nSureSelectXT custom-capture bait library for further resequencing\\nof the coding and splice-junction regions of this 78-gene set\\n(Dataset S1, Table S6). We first used this custom-capture kit to\\nresequence the 29 paired AA CRC tumor and normal discovery\\nsamples, adding manual review of all mutation calls. Following\\nthis resequencing, 52 genes remained as demonstrating muta-\\ntions in at least two individual discovery set cancers (Dataset S1,\\nTable S7).\\nWe next resequenced these 52 candidate mutation target\\ngenes in a second cohort of 77 MSS AA CRCs that were pre-\\ndominantly early stage (Dataset S1, Table S8). Three of the 77\\ncancers were found to be hypermutated and were excluded from\\nsubsequent analyses (Fig. S1 and Dataset S1, Table S8). Among\\nthe 74 informative AA CRC validation cases, a total of 59\\nnonsilent mutations were detected in 27 genes Dataset S1, Table\\nS9). Using the statistical method detailed in our prior CRC se-\\nquencing study (6), we compared the observed to expected mu-\\ntation rates (Dataset S1, Table S4) for each of the 52 candidate\\ntarget genes. Twenty genes were identified as being significantly\\nmutated [P < 0.05, false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] in the\\ndiscovery AA CRC cohort and as again being significantly mu-\\ntated in the AA CRC validation cohort (Table 1 and Dataset S1,\\nTable S10). The finding of these 20 genes as reproducibly sig-\\nnificantly mutated above background suggests that they legiti-\\nmately represent new genes targeted for recurrent mutation in\\ncolon cancer and that have been newly identified in AA CRCs.\\nSignificance\\nColorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths\\nworld-wide. African Americans exhibit the highest colon cancer\\nincidence and mortality among all ethnic groups in the United\\nStates. Despite this finding, there is a dearth of knowledge on\\nthe genetic mechanisms underlying colon carcinogenesis in\\nAfrican Americans. We thus initiated this study to characterize\\nthe mutational landscapes of African American colon cancers.\\nWe identified new genes that are significantly mutated in colon\\ncancer and that are highly preferentially targeted for mutations\\nin colon cancers arising in African Americans as compared with\\nCaucasians. These findings suggest differences in routes of co-\\nlon carcinogenesis between the different ethnic groups and\\nalso may have implications for the ethnicity associated differ-\\nences in tumor incidence and outcome.\\nAuthor contributions: K.G., S.D.M., and J.E.W. designed research; K.G., M.L.V., L.R., J.L.,\\nand L.B. performed research; K.G., V.V., A.N., J.K.V.W., N.M., A.M., M.D.A., and J.E.W.\\ncontributed new reagents/analytic tools; K.G., W.D.S., Z.J.W., R.C.E., and S.D.M. analyzed\\ndata; and K.G. and S.D.M. wrote the paper.\\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\\n1M.L.V. and V.V. contributed equally to this work.\\n2S.D.M. and J.E.W. contributed equally to this work.\\n3To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Similarly, mutations in fol-\\nliculin (FLCN) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 1F\\n(HTR1F) were also detected exclusively in AA cases (Table 2).\\nBecause of the lower mutation frequencies for FLCN and\\nHTR1F, association with AA ethnicity was of lesser statistical\\nsignificance (P = 0.086 for each gene) (Table 2).\\nAmong the newly identified mutational targets, two genes,\\nEPHA6 and FLCN, were of particular interest because of their\\nbeing mutated exclusively in AA CRC as well as their belonging\\nto known oncogenic pathways. Sanger sequencing successfully\\nreconfirmed each of the nine somatic mutations we had detected\\nin these two genes (Fig. S4). The six somatic mutations detected\\nin EPHA6 occurred throughout the gene (Fig. 1). One mutation\\naltered a canonical splice site, and four missense mutations were\\npredicted to significantly alter protein function (Fig. 1). This\\ngenetic pattern would be consistent with EPHA6 having activity\\nas a CRC tumor suppressor. Supporting this argument, EPHA6\\nis a member of the broader family of ephrin receptor tyrosine\\nkinases that have been demonstrated to function as oncogenes or\\ntumor suppressors depending on the disease context (12). For\\nexample, EPHA3 and EPHB6 were both identified as signifi-\\ncantly mutated genes in our previous analysis of the colon cancer\\ngenome of a near all Caucasian MSS CRC cohort (6). Intriguingly,\\nto our knowledge the present study is the first to implicate EPHA6\\nin CRCs, with the finding of EPHA6 somatic mutations in ∼6%\\nof the AA CRC cases suggesting a provocative ethnicity-associ-\\nated difference in selection of a different EPH family member\\nfor mutational targeting (Fig. 1 and Table 2).\\nAlthough less frequent, the three mutations detected in FLCN\\nwere also notable in that they included two frameshift and one\\nnonsense mutation (Fig. 1). Moreover, inactivating germ-line\\nFLCN mutations are associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome,\\ncharacterized by development of medullary thyroid carcinomas,\\nperifollicular fibromas, and renal cancers (13), a phenotype re-\\ncapitulated in mice lacking a single Flcn allele (14). Further-\\nmore, colon neoplasia has also been reported in some individuals\\nwith Birt-Hogg-Dubé (15). Taking these data together, we pro-\\npose EPHA6 and FLCN as candidate driver genes preferentially\\ntargeted for mutation in AA CRCs.\\nIn identifying the association of the above gene mutations with\\nAA CRC, it was key to recurate the publicly available mutational\\ndatabases (4, 6, 7, 16) to identify an appropriate comparator group\\nof nonhypermutator CRCs (details in Materials and Methods).\\nFor example, the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer\\n(COSMIC) database reports 18 FLCN CRC mutations; however,\\n17 are in hypermutator CRCs [nearly all with microsatellite insta-\\nblility (MSI)], and one variant is unconfirmed as being somatic plus\\nis in an individual of unknown ethnicity (Dataset S1, Table S13).\\nSimilarly, of 48 reported EPHA6 mutations in CRCs, 39 are in\\nhypermutator CRCs, 4 are silent mutations, 4 are variants not de-\\ntermined as somatic, and the one remaining variant is in a patient of\\nunknown ethnicity (Dataset S1, Table S13).\\n"), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nIn summary, by sequencing AA CRCs, we have identified 20 new\\ngenes as significantly mutated in CRCs. Mutations in a set of 15\\nof these genes appear to be strongly preferentially associated\\nwith CRCs arising in AA versus Caucasian individuals, suggesting\\nan important difference in the mutational landscapes of CRCs\\narising in different ethnic groups. Moreover, mutations in EPHA6\\nand FLCN, which are unique to AA CRCs, are highly likely to be\\nAA CRC driver mutations, as supported by the likely inactivating\\nnature of these mutations and by the biological pathways in which\\nthese two genes participate. One limitation of this study is that\\nour cohort of cases was drawn exclusively from northeastern\\nOhio. The history of differing patterns of internal migration of\\nAfrican American individuals in America will make it of clear\\ninterest to compare these findings with those in African American\\ncommunities from other regions of the country.

Only tumors with MSS were included in the study. The tumor\\nstage, sex, race, MSI status, and tissue source of the DNA for the AA dis-\\ncovery and validation cases in the study are detailed in Dataset S1, Tables S1\\nand S8, respectively, and for the Caucasian CRC cases in Dataset S1, Table\\nS11. Before use, all tissue samples were reviewed by an anatomic pathologist\\n(J.E.W.) to confirm the colon cancer diagnosis and to confirm a cancer cell\\ncontent in the sample of greater than or equal to 50%.\\nWhole-Exome DNA Sequencing. A total of 31 advanced-stage MSS AA CRC and\\nmatched normal sample DNAs were selected for whole-exome sequencing\\n(WES) as part of the discovery screen (Dataset S1, Table S1). Target capture,\\nlibrary preparation, and deep sequencing were performed by the Oklahoma\\nMedical Research Foundation Next Generation DNA Sequencing Core Facil-\\nity (Oklahoma City, OK). Target sequence enrichments were performed us-\\ning the Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit as per the manufacturer’s\\nprotocols (Illumina). Briefly, sample DNAs were quantified using a picogreen\\nfluorometric assay and 3 μg of genomic DNA were randomly sheared to an\\naverage size of 300 bp using a Covaris S2 sonicator (Covaris). Sonicated DNA\\nwas then end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated with indexed paired-end Illu-\\nmina adapters. Target capture was performed on DNA pooled from six\\nindexed samples, following which, the captured library was PCR amplified for\\n10 cycles to enrich for target genomic regions. The captured libraries were\\nprecisely quantified using a quantitative PCR-based Kapa Biosystems library\\nquantification kit (Kapa Biosystems) on a Roche Lightcycler 480 (Roche Ap-\\nplied Science). Deep sequencing of the capture-enriched pools was per-\\nformed on an Illumina HiSEq. 2000 instrument with 100-bp, paired-end reads.\\nFor tumors, pools of six captured libraries were sequenced across three lanes\\non the HiSeq instrument. For normal samples, pools of six captured libraries\\nwere sequenced across two lanes on the HiSeq instrument. DNA from the\\nnormal tissue, matched to tumor sample 11481, failed at library generation\\nphase, and accordingly was not sequenced (Dataset S1, Table S1).\\nRead Mapping, Somatic Mutation Detection, and Annotation. Burrows-\\nWheeler Aligner (19) was used to align individual 100-bp reads from the raw\\nFASTQ files to the human reference genome (build hg19) with default\\nparameters. Following the conversion of aligned reads into Binary Sequence\\nAlignment/Map format, coverage metrics of target bases were calculated\\nusing the Picard tools (samtools.sourceforge.net). The coverage statistics for\\nthe WES samples are detailed in Dataset S1, Table S2. Somatic variations\\n(point mutations and indels) in tumor samples were detected using three\\nalgorithms specifically developed for normal-tumor paired analyses. Point\\nmutations were detected using MuTect (8) and VarScan 2 (10), and indels\\nwere detected using VarScan 2 (10) and Genome "), Document(page_content='Analysis Toolkit Somatic\\nindel detector (9). All algorithms were set to default parameters, and with\\nthe matched normal samples serving as reference genomes. For each tumor,\\nwe took the union of all somatic variants predicted by the three algorithms\\nfor subsequent analyses. To address the possibility that some sequencing\\nerrors might still be detected in a tumor only but not in its respective\\nmatched-normal sample, thus generating a false somatic variant call, we\\nadditionally performed a comprehensive query comparing each of the pre-\\nsumed somatic variants identified in tumors against the entire matched-\\nnormal sample-set plus an additional 123 platform-matched germ-line\\nsamples using the SAMtools software package (20). Presumptive somatic\\nmutations that were well detected in sequencing reads of 10% or more of\\ngerm-line normal samples sequenced on the same targeted capture plat-\\nform presumptively represent recurrent sequencing or mapping errors, and\\nwere subsequently eliminated after confirmation by manual review using\\nthe Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software (21). Additionally, variants\\nidentified as somatic variants by only one of the three callers were filtered-\\nout whenever the variant allele frequency observed in respective matched\\nnormal sample was ≥10% or if the variant was found in public databases\\n(22) (evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS). The final list of predicted somatic variants\\nwas mapped to the human transcriptome reference database (RefSeq, build\\nhg19) using a variant annotation tool developed in-house (SLATE), which\\nidentifies variants mapping to gene-coding regions and splice-sites, in-\\ncluding their corresponding positions and codon changes within respective\\ntranscripts.\\nOf the 31 colon tumors used in the discovery exome analysis, one of the\\ntumors, 3213, was found to be hypermutated and therefore was not included\\nin subsequent analyses (Fig. S1 and Dataset S1, Table S1). As mentioned\\nabove, in a second tumor sample, 11481, library preparation from the\\nmatched normal tissue failed. Private variants identified in this tumor were\\nexamined for the purpose of nominating genes for inclusion on an Agilent\\nSureSelectXT custom capture bait library (described below), but were oth-\\nerwise excluded from all statistical analyses. The overall background muta-\\ntion rate in the remaining 29 discovery exome samples was estimated using\\nthe Genome MuSiC software package (23) (Dataset S1, Table S4).\\nComparative '), Document(page_content="Analysis of Genes Mutated in the AA CRC Discovery Exomes with\\nPrior Studies in CRCs. We used the following workflow to determine if AA\\nCRCs showed recurrent somatic mutations in genes that were not previously\\nidentified in CRCs (4, 6, 7). First, we identified a panel of 385 genes showing\\nrecurrent mutations in the AA CRC discovery screen: that is, with nonsilent\\nmutations in at least two individual cancers, including the unpaired tumor\\nsample from the discovery screen. Next, we derived the Entrez gene iden-\\ntifiers for each of the 385 genes in the AA CRC discovery dataset using the\\nmappings provided by the org.Hs.eg.db database from Bioconductor (24),\\nand by using org.Hs.egSYMBOL2EG object. Next, we obtained a list of all\\ngenes showing nonsilent somatic mutations in MSS nonhypermutator CRCs\\nfrom three prior large-scale sequencing studies in CRCs for which ethnicity\\ndata were available from most of the cases (4, 6, 7). Data from two tumors\\nannotated as from AA cases was removed. Then, using the Entrez identifiers\\nas anchor and org.Hs.egALIAS2EG object, we checked if any of the aliases of\\nthe 385 genes identified in the AA CRC dataset were observed in the mu-\\ntational datasets from these prior studies (4, 6, 7). In parallel, we performed\\nmanual curation of respective datasets wherever necessary. Overall, 288\\ngenes in the AA CRC dataset showed at least one nonsilent somatic mutation\\nin prior studies of MSS nonhypermutator CRCs (4, 6, 7). For 97 of the 385\\ngenes in the AA CRC dataset, we found no prior reports demonstrating\\nprotein-altering mutations among MSS nonhypermutator CRCs (4, 6, 7)\\n(Dataset S1, Table S5). Further review of the mutations in 97 genes using IGV\\n(21) resulted in the exclusion of 19 genes, with mutations being observed in\\nregions of poor mappability and mutations that were obvious sequencing\\nerrors. In the end, 78 candidate genes in the AA CRC exome dataset that met\\nour above inclusion criteria were selected for subsequent analyses.\\nTargeted Resequencing of Candidate AA CRC Genes. A custom Agilent Sure-\\nSelectXT bait library (Agilent Technologies) was designed for targeted cap-\\nture and resequencing of a panel of 78 candidate genes that were selected\\nbased on: (i) no prior evidence of their being mutational targets in micro-\\nsatellite stable nonhypermutator colon cancers (4, 6, 7), as described above;\\nand (ii) each of these 78 candidate AA CRC genes showing nonsilent somatic\\nmutations in two or more individual cancers from the exome dataset. Six-\\nteen of these 78 genes were nominated by noticing a private nonsilent\\nvariant in the unpaired 11481 tumor sample plus an additional somatic\\nmutation in the 29 discovery samples (Dataset S1, Table S5). Although used\\nto help nominate these 16 candidates, data from this unpaired tumor was\\nexcluded from all further statistical analysis. In addition to the set of 78 can-\\ndidate genes, a panel of 135 genes was included as controls on the custom-\\ncapture bait library to facilitate the identification of hypermutated cancers in\\nanalysis of the validation tumor cohort (Dataset S1, Table S6).\\nCustom capture and resequencing were performed as follows. Briefly, 3 μg\\nof sample DNAs were randomly sheared to obtain a target peak size of 150–\\n200 bp using a Covaris S2 sonicator. Sonicated DNA was then end-repaired,\\nA-tailed, adapter-ligated, amplified, and quality-assessed using a Tape-\\nStation instrument (Agilent Technologies). Next, 750 ng of the library was\\nindividually captured using the Agilent custom-capture bait library, and PCR\\namplification of the captured libraries was carried out for 14 cycles during\\nwhich unique indexed tags were added to respective sample libraries. The\\ncaptured libraries were precisely quantified using a quantitative PCR-based\\nAgilent library quantification kit. Samples libraries were pooled in batches of\\n24–48, and each pooled library was deep-sequenced on a single lane of Illu-\\nmina HiSEq. 2000 instrument to obtain 100-bp paired-end reads. Estimation of\\ncoverage statistics in samples used for targeted resequencing showed an av-\\nerage of 95% of bases covered at 30X depth, with 99% of samples showing at\\nleast 90% of the bases covered at 30X. Read mapping, somatic mutation de-\\ntection, and annotation for targeted resequencing analysis was carried out as\\ndetailed above.\\nResequencing analysis of the 78 candidate AA CRC genes in the discovery\\nexome samples resulted in 52 genes confirmed as being mutated in at least\\ntwo cancers (Dataset S1, Table S7). The remaining 26 genes included 19\\ngenes with a mutation confirmed in only one of the discovery cancers, and\\nan additional 7 genes for which none of the mutations observed in the WES\\nvalidated. These 26 genes were excluded from subsequent analyses.

To identify which among the 52 candidate\\nAA CRC genes were mutated more frequently than expected based on the\\noverall background mutation rate in AA CRCs, we followed a statistical\\nframework similar to our previously published study detailing mutational\\nprofiles of colon cancer (6). First, the overall background mutation rates at six\\ndifferent nucleotide contexts, including AT transitions, AT transversions, CG\\ntransitions, CP transversions, CpG transitions, and CpG transversions were\\ncalculated using the Genome MuSiC suite (23) in the exome samples (Dataset\\nS1, Table S4). Next, for each of the 52 candidate genes, we counted the\\nnumber of mutations in each of the above six nucleotide contexts plus indels\\nin the discovery exome dataset, and calculated the probability of the ob-\\nserved number of mutations in a particular category using an exact binomial\\ndistribution. The total probability of a gene exhibiting the observed number\\nof mutations in all of the seven categories was then calculated to be the\\nproduct of the seven context-specific probabilities. To correct these proba-\\nbilities for multiple comparisons, we used the algorithm described by\\nBenjamini and Hochberg (25). Genes with a P value < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05\\nwere considered to be significantly mutated. Mutational significance for the\\ncandidate genes in the African American validation cohort were similarly\\ncalculated using context-specific background mutation rate values derived\\nfrom the exome dataset (Dataset S1, Table S4). Overall, 20 genes were found\\nto be significantly mutated in both the discovery and validation African\\nAmerican cohorts (Table 1 and Dataset S1, Table S10). We note that using\\na selection criteria requiring that genes be significantly mutated in both the\\ndiscovery and the validation cohorts may overlook some genes that could\\nvalidate on further testing. However, we selected the above algorithm in the\\ninterest of minimizing any false discovery.\\nComparison of Mutational Frequencies of the 20 Candidate Genes in AA vs.\\nCaucasian CRCs. The 20 significantly mutated genes in AA CRCs (Table 2)\\nwere resequenced in a panel of 129 fresh-frozen, predominantly late-stage\\nMSS Caucasian CRC and matched normal DNA samples, using the Agilent\\ncustom-capture bait library described above (Dataset S1, Tables S6, S11, and\\nS12). We then evaluated if the overall mutational frequency of these 20\\ngenes, as a group, is significantly higher in the AA (discovery + validation\\ncohorts, n = 103) versus Caucasian (n = 129) CRCs by using a paired Student’s\\nt test. Taken as a group, these 20 genes averaged a statistically significant\\n∼twofold increase in the total number of mutations/tumor in AA CRCs\\ncompared with Caucasian CRCs (P < 0.001). After finding the statistical sig-\\nnificance for differences in these 20 genes taken as a group between AA and\\nCaucasian CRCs, subgroup analysis was done by comparing for each in-\\ndividual gene the difference in the mutational frequencies between AA and\\nCaucasian CRCs using a Fisher’s exact test. EPHA6 showed the most signifi-\\ncant nominal P value of 0.007. Further subgroup analysis was done by\\nranking the 20 genes from most to least significant nominal P values, and\\nconsecutively performing a paired Student’s t test on groups of the top 2, 3,\\n4 . . . 20 genes. The nominal P value was most significant for the group\\nconsisting of the top 15 genes (P = 1.8 × 10−8) (Fig. S3).\\nThe above statistical results are not critically dependent on use of a paired\\nStudent’s t test. For example, analysis using the less powerful Wilcoxon\\nsigned-rank and Sign tests also identify the set of 20 candidate genes as\\nhaving significantly more mutations in AA vs. Caucasian CRCs (P < 0.002\\nand < 0.001, respectively).\\nIn the above analysis, presented in Table 2, genes with two mutations in\\nthe same patient were counted only once. These included one instance each\\nof: CHD5 (AA validation), KIAA1551 (AA validation), WDR87 (AA validation),\\nTCEB3CL (Caucasian validation), WDR87 (Caucasian validation) (Dataset S1,\\nTables S9 and S12). Counting these additional mutations would not have\\nchanged the above conclusions.\\nOf note, comparison of mutational frequencies of well-known CRC\\ndriver genes (APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, SMAD4, BRAF, FBXW7), as a\\ngroup, showed no significant differences between AA versus Caucasian\\nCRCs, although KRAS and FBXW7 individually showed a significantly\\nhigher mutation frequency in AA than Caucasian CRCs (Dataset S1, Table\\nS14). Increased KRAS mutations in AA CRCs has also been previously\\nreported by others (1, 3).\\nIdentification of Hypermutator Tumors. All tumors sequenced in the above\\nanalyses were first screened for MSI, with only MSS CRC cases included for\\nsequencing. Moreover, following sequencing, MSS hypermutator tumors\\nwere also identified and excluded from analysis. In the whole-exome data,\\nMSS hypermutator tumors were identified using the criterion from the\\npublished The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study (4), assigning samples with\\na mutation rate >12 per 106 base pairs (corresponding to total mutation\\ncount >237) as hypermutators (4). One discovery sample met this definition\\nand was excluded (sample 3213, total mutations = 587, total nonsilent\\nmutations = 447) (Fig. S1). In targeted capture data, cases with mutation\\ncounts outside the body of the mutation distribution were classified as\\nhypermutators. Three AA validation cases met this definition and were\\nexcluded (Fig. S1). Of note, no Caucasian cases were excluded from the\\nanalysis using these criteria. Thus, the exclusion of one AA discovery and\\nthree AA validation cases is highly conservative with respect to our final\\nconclusions.\\nCuration of EPHA6 and FLCN Mutations in COSMIC Database. We obtained a list\\nof all mutations reported for EPHA6 and FLCN genes in cecum, colon, and\\nrectal cancers within the COSMIC database (16), which includes mutational\\ndata from all four published large-scale sequencing studies in CRCs (4–7)\\n(accession date 07/20/2014) (Dataset S1, Table S13). For each tumor sample,\\nwe calculated the total number of unique mutations. Tumor samples derived\\nfrom TCGA datasets within COSMIC, that were not in published literature,\\nwere annotated for race, MSI status, and tumor stage, where available,\\nusing the TCGA data-portal (tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga, accession date 06/05/\\n2014). Tumor samples with MSI status designated as MSI-H were automati-\\ncally assigned hypermutator status. Moreover, among the tumors desig-\\nnated as either MSS, MSI-L, or unknown, we observed total mutation counts\\nranging from 106 to 12,202, suggesting that several of these samples were\\nalso hypermutators. Accordingly, to identify MSS hypermutator tumors we\\nadapted the criterion from the published TCGA study, assigning samples\\nwith a mutation rate >12 per 106 (corresponding to total mutation count\\n>237) as hypermutators (4). The median mutation count among these MSS\\nhypermutator tumors was 1,204 in the COSMIC dataset. The condensed\\nsummary of our analyses as provided in Dataset S1, Table S13 shows that the\\nvast majority of reported EPHA6 and FLCN mutations (56 of 66) were derived\\nfrom hypermutator cases, with the remaining variants not characterized as\\nbeing somatic versus germ line (5 of 66) or being silent mutations (4 of 66).\\nOverall, we found one MSS nonhypermutator tumor showing a confirmed\\nsomatic missense mutation in EPHA6; however, the ethnicity of this patient\\nwas unknown (Dataset S1, Table S13).\\nSanger Sequencing. The primers for amplifying mutant positions in EPHA6\\nand FLCN genes are listed in Dataset S1, Table S15. The PCR conditions in-\\ncluded 95 °C for 4 min, 38 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 62.3 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C\\nfor 45 s. Each reaction was carried out in a 50-μL reaction volume using 2.5 U\\nof Fast-TAQ DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) with 25–50 ng of\\ntemplate DNA. The PCR products were purified and were either directly\\nsequenced using universal M13 forward and reverse primers or sequenced\\nfollowing subcloning the PCR products in bacteria.

However, up to 30% of patients \\nwith advanced GCTs develop cisplatin-resistant disease, which \\nrequires intensive salvage treatment and has a 50% risk of can-\\ncer-related death (2). In particular, primary mediastinal nonsem-\\ninomatous GCTs (PM NSGCTs) have an adverse prognosis and a \\nhigh frequency of cisplatin resistance (3). Moreover, diverse forms \\nof somatic type malignancies including sarcomas, carcinomas, \\nand a variety of hematologic malignancies can arise in patients \\nwith mediastinal GCTs (4, 5). For example, 1 in every 17 patients \\nwith PM NSGCT will develop a hematologic malignancy (5, 6), a \\nclinical presentation associated with a dismal median survival of \\nless than 6 months.\\nAlthough initially presumed to represent a therapy-induced \\nsecondary complication of chemotherapy, a shared clonal origin \\nfor GCTs and hematologic malignancies arising in the same indi-\\nvidual has been suggested by the occasional shared presence of \\nisochromosome 12p [i(12p)], a clonal marker common in GCTs \\nbut absent in hematologic cancers (7–10). Although the identi-\\nfication of i(12p) in hematologic malignancies arising in GCT \\npatients suggests a clonal relationship between the 2 disorders \\n(7–10), the evolutionary dynamics and comprehensive charac-\\nterization of the genomic features of this syndrome have thus far \\nbeen lacking. Given the totipotent nature of GCTs, it has been \\npostulated that hematologic malignancies arising in this setting \\nare derived directly from cells within the fully formed GCT that \\nhave the capacity to differentiate into hematopoietic tissue (11, \\n12). However, a competing hypothesis is that a progenitor with the \\ncapacity to differentiate into germ cell and hematopoietic lineages \\nharbors the initiating genetic alterations and drives development \\nGerm cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 40. Although most patients are \\ncured, those with disease arising in the mediastinum have distinctly poor outcomes. One in every 17 patients with primary \\nmediastinal nonseminomatous GCTs develop an incurable hematologic malignancy and prior data intriguingly suggest a \\nclonal relationship exists between hematologic malignancies and GCTs in these cases. To date, however, the precise clonal \\nrelationship between GCTs and the diverse additional somatic malignancies arising in such individuals have not been \\ndetermined. Here, we traced the clonal evolution and characterized the genetic features of each neoplasm from a cohort of \\n15 patients with GCTs and associated hematologic malignancies. We discovered that GCTs and hematologic malignancies \\ndeveloping in such individuals evolved from a common shared precursor, nearly all of which harbored allelically imbalanced \\np53 and/or RAS pathway mutations. Hematologic malignancies arising in this setting genetically resembled mediastinal GCTs \\nrather than de novo myeloid neoplasms. Our findings argue that this scenario represents a unique clinical syndrome, distinct \\nfrom de novo GCTs or hematologic malignancies, initiated by an ancestral precursor that gives rise to the parallel evolution of \\nGCTs and blood cancers in these patients.\\nGerm cell tumors and associated hematologic \\nmalignancies evolve from a common shared precursor\\nJustin Taylor,1,2 Mark T.A.

Although a complex karyotype with \\nmultiple chromosome abnormalities was evident in the majority \\nof hematologic malignancies developing in the setting of GCTs, \\ni(12p) could be identified as an isolated clone by conventional \\ncytogenetics in several of these individuals, suggesting i(12p) as \\nan early event in these cases (Supplemental Figure 3 and Supple-\\nmental Table 3). In addition to i(12p), shared mutations in TP53 \\nwere present in 91% of patients with mediastinal GCTs with \\nhematologic malignancies versus 61% of patients with medias-\\ntinal GCTs lacking hematologic malignancies and in only 9% of \\npatients with de novo AML (Figure 1C). Given recent data on the \\nassociation of p53 pathway alterations and cisplatin resistance \\nin GCTs (14) and the known adverse prognostic effect of TP53 \\nalterations in myeloid neoplasms (15–17), the nearly obligate \\npresence of TP53 mutations in GCTs and their associated sec-\\nondary blood cancers provides one basis for the short surviv-\\nal of these patients. Activating mutations in KRAS and NRAS \\naccounted for 63% and 37% of mediastinal GCTs with hema-\\ntologic malignancies and without accompanying hematologic \\nmalignancies, respectively, but were present in only 13% of de \\nnovo AML. In contrast to shared genetic similarities in i(12p), \\nTP53 alterations, and mutations activating RAS/PI3K signal-\\ning in GCTs and their associated blood cancers, blood cancers \\narising in association with GCTs lacked mutations in the most \\ncommonly mutated genes in AML, MDS, or clonal hematopoie-\\nsis (such as FLT3, DNMT3A, TET2, and NPM1 mutations; Figure \\n1, C and D). These findings suggest that the hematologic malig-\\nnancies developing in the setting of GCTs are clonally related to \\nmediastinal GCTs and have a pathogenesis distinct from other \\nhematopoietic malignancies. This represents a possible basis \\nfor their treatment refractoriness, as these blood cancers are \\nmolecularly distinct from the hematologic malignancies they \\nhistologically mimic.\\nWe next sought to trace the evolutionary origin of each \\ndistinct cancer type developing in these patients by using the \\nsomatic mutational and DNA copy number data from WES in \\n5 patients (Figure 2, Figure 3C, and Figure 4F). In every such \\npatient, we identified divergent genetic evolution of the GCT \\nand blood cancer, with putative driver alterations unique to \\neach malignancy (sometimes in the same gene). In contrast to \\nprior data that secondary malignancies developing in the setting \\nof GCTs represent malignant transformation of differentiat-\\ned GCT components such as teratoma and yolk sac tumor (11, \\n12), the present data suggest instead that these malignancies \\nevolved independently from a shared ancestral clone common \\nto both malignancies (Supplemental Figure 1). For example, in \\none 24-year-old male with concurrent PM NSGCT and CMML, \\nboth cancers had i(12p) and KRAS G12S mutations, along with 8 \\nadditional shared truncal mutations of unknown functional sig-\\nnificance (Figure 2, A–C). These alterations were then followed \\nby the independent acquisition of a distinct set of mutations \\n(including oncogenic mutations) and copy number alterations \\n(CNAs) arising after a branching of their disease evolution, \\nthereby indicating that both conditions developed from a shared \\nprecursor (as opposed to dedifferentiation or histologic trans-\\nof both malignancies (10) (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental \\nmaterial available online with this article; https:/\\n/doi.org/10.1172/\\nJCI139682DS1). To trace the clonal origins of these multiple \\nmalignancies within individual patients and understand their \\ncomprehensive genomic features, we performed broad mutation-\\nal and copy number analyses of GCTs, the hematologic malignan-\\ncies developing in these individuals, and patient-matched normal \\nDNA from a cohort of 15 patients.\\n"), Document(page_content="Results\\nWe identified 15 individuals diagnosed with GCT and co-inci-\\ndent hematologic malignancies over a 21-year period (1998–2019; \\nFigure 1A and Supplemental Table 1; Methods). Despite allowing \\nthe collection of GCTs from any gender and histologic subtype, \\nall patients developing GCTs and concurrent blood cancers were \\nmales between the age of 18 and 33 (median age 25) with PM \\nNSGCTs. The most common GCT histology was a teratoma com-\\nponent (present in 73% and as the predominant histology in 60% \\nof cases) mixed with nonseminomatous components, most com-\\nmonly a yolk sac tumor component (present in 53%; more details \\nin Supplemental Table 1).\\nOverall, the median time between GCT and blood cancer \\ndiagnoses was only 4.8 months, while 4 patients concurrent-\\nly developed their GCT and hematologic cancer before any \\nanticancer therapy (Figure 1A). The most common hemato-\\nlogic malignancy was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 53% \\nof patients, but myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), histiocytic \\nsarcoma, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were \\nalso diagnosed in 2 or more patients each. Nearly half of the \\nAMLs seen in this setting were acute megakaryoblastic leuke-\\nmias (M7 AML). However, one-third of the cohort developed \\nmultiple distinct clinical subtypes of hematologic malignan-\\ncies, often in a temporally distinct manner (Figure 1A and Sup-\\nplemental Table 1).\\nConsistent with prior reports documenting the poor sur-\\nvival of patients who develop both GCTs and hematologic \\nmalignancies (7–10), the median survival of this cohort was 6.3 \\nmonths (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6–25.2 months) (Figure \\n1B).

At the same time, the fact that hematologic \\nmalignancies bearing i(12p) do not develop unless accompanied by \\na GCT strongly suggests that hematologic malignancies present in \\nthis setting derive from a precursor along the GCT lineage.\\nAll patients here who developed a hematologic malignancy \\nclonally related to GCT had a PM NSGCT and we did not identify \\nany patients with testicular or seminomatous GCTs that developed \\na clonally related hematologic malignancy. Although this is consis-\\ntent with prior reports (7–10), the basis for the specific association \\nbetween somatic type hematologic malignancies and PM NSGCTs \\nremains unclear. Overall, our data are consistent with the model \\nthat PM NSGCTs are derived from transformed primordial germ \\ncells lodged in the mediastinum, which have been reprogrammed \\nto embryonal carcinoma cells and are believed to be the initiating \\ncells of NSGCTs (21). Indeed, none of the hematologic malignan-\\ncies here were preceded by a pure seminoma, making it unlikely \\nthat they can be derived directly from a primordial germ cell. Thus, \\nwe hypothesize that the precursor to both PM NSGCTs and clon-\\nally related hematologic malignancies in these individuals may be \\nembryonal carcinoma cells, which have the potential to differenti-\\nate toward all components of an NSGCT as well as hematopoietic \\nprecursor cells. This is distinct from prior studies (11, 12), which \\npostulated that hematologic malignancies in these cases develop \\nfrom teratomas or yolk sac elements within the GCT.\\nThe unique genetic features of hematologic malignancies in \\nGCT patients along with the high frequency of TP53 alterations \\nlikely explains the frequent cisplatin resistance in this patient pop-\\nulation as well the ineffectiveness of therapies used for high-risk \\nMDS and AML. This clinical scenario is particularly unique given \\nthe co-occurrence of multiple, otherwise unrelated rare cancer \\ntypes in a young adult population and the fact that this condition \\nis invariably fatal. As such, future studies to evaluate for potential \\ngermline genetic predisposition for the development of hemato-\\nlogic malignancies in the setting of GCTs are warranted. Of note, \\n2 patients with PM NSGCT that developed hematologic malignan-\\ncies here had clinical diagnoses of Klinefelter syndrome, consis-\\ntent with prior data regarding increased incidence of PM NSGCT \\nin patients with Klinefelter syndrome (22). Although none of the \\n41 additional PM NSGCT patients without hematologic malignan-\\ncies had known Klinefelter syndrome, further germline genomic \\nanalysis would be needed to evaluate for potential mosaicism or \\nsubclinical Klinefelter syndrome in these individuals. Of note, we \\nidentify far more diverse forms of myeloid neoplasms developing \\nin this setting than appreciated in prior studies and observed that \\nmultiple genetically distinct myeloid neoplasms often develop in \\nindividual patients affected by this condition. Overall, these find-\\nings argue that the development of blood cancers in patients with \\nGCTs represents a unique clinical syndrome wherein the aggres-\\nsive hematologic malignancies in these individuals do not arise \\nfrom the hematopoietic system, like de novo hematologic malig-\\nnancies, but rather develop from the same cell of origin as the GCT.\\nMethods\\nPathology review.

Notably, this patient’s GCT \\ndid not have the i(12p) abnormality and thus might not have been \\nidentified as having clonally related GCT and leukemia based on \\nkaryotype alone.\\nHigh-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplan-\\ntation (auto-SCT) is a treatment for relapsed GCTs (18), a clinical \\nscenario encompassing some of the GCT patients in this study. \\nGiven recent recognition for the potential for contamination of \\nhematopoietic stem cell transplant products with clonal hemato-\\npoiesis (CH) (19), we next sought to determine if there was CH in \\nthe G-CSF–mobilized stem cell products collected from individu-\\nals with high-risk PM GCTs. We therefore performed genetic anal-\\nysis of G-CSF–mobilized hematopoietic stem cell products from 5 \\nPM GCT patients who had undergone stem collection for potential \\nautologous transplantation (Supplemental Table 3). Only 1 patient \\nfrom this cohort developed a subsequent hematologic malignan-\\ncy, despite undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with auto-SCT as \\ntreatment for their high-risk GCT; he developed a clonally related \\nMDS shortly thereafter (1 year after GCT diagnosis) (Figure 4A). \\nAfter a subsequent allogeneic SCT, the patient developed a second \\nclinically and histologically distinct hematologic malignancy — a \\nhistiocytic sarcoma (Figure 4B). WES revealed that all 3 tumors \\nwere host derived and shared a somatic BCOR G943D mutation as \\nwell as an RRAS2 activating mutation with CNLOH (Figure 4, C–F). \\nEvery disease thereafter acquired TP53 mutations with CNLOH \\n(Figure 4, D–G, and Supplemental Figure 4). Again, the acquisi-\\ntion of a different TP53 mutation and successive independent LOH \\nevent in the histiocytic sarcoma suggest secondary malignancies \\ndeveloping from a precursor clone that also gave rise to the GCT \\n(Figure 4, D–G). To confirm, we sequenced the auto-SCT product, \\nwhich was collected from the patient before being diagnosed with \\nhematologic malignancies, only to find that the mobilized stem \\ncell product did not contain any mutations (Figure 4C). As with this \\nindex case, none of 4 additional PM GCT patients with auto-SCT \\nproducts sequenced had evidence of CH (Supplemental Table 3), \\nwhich is consistent with the rarity of CH in GCT patients overall \\n(20). Together, these data suggest that the hematologic malignan-\\ncies seen in these patients did not arise from the hematopoietic sys-\\ntem, but rather developed from the same cell of origin as the GCT.\\n"), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nThe development of clonally related somatic type cancers in the \\nsetting of GCTs has been recognized for nearly 30 years (5) and is \\nmarked by a very poor outcome, despite modern therapy for both \\ncancer types.

The OncoKB \\nknowledge base was used to identify oncogenic alterations (26). For the \\npost–allogeneic transplant histiocytic sarcoma sample from patient 2 (Fig-\\nure 4), likely true somatic mutations were distinguished from donor-de-\\nrived contamination using the variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations \\npreviously identified in preallogeneic samples from the same patient along \\nwith the known zygosity of those mutations in said samples (Supplemen-\\ntal Figure 4). This sample was also excluded from copy number analysis. \\nPatient 3’s NRAS mutation in their histiocytic sarcoma sample was initially \\nidentified in additional IMPACT sequencing, read support 2.05% (14 of \\n683), reaching the threshold for reporting oncogenic/hotspot mutations. \\nRead support in the WES was 1.02% (2 of 197). The same NRAS mutation \\nwas not present in other the histologic components via IMPACT sequenc-\\ning (GCT: 0 of 874; CMML: 1 of 358; AML: 0 of 574).\\nAllele-specific copy number analysis and cancer cell fractions. \\nGenome-wide total and allele-specific DNA copy number, purity, and \\nploidy were calculated for all exome data (FACETS version 0.5.6; ref. \\n27). Only clonal CNAs were considered, i.e., copy number segments \\nwith a cellular fraction having 80% or greater estimated purity. The \\nexpected number of copies for each mutation was generated based on \\nobserved VAF and local ploidy (28). Cancer cell fractions were calcu-\\nlated using a binomial distribution and maximum likelihood estima-\\ntion normalized to produce posterior probabilities (29).\\nPhylogenetic reconstruction. Clone trees were manually construct-\\ned based on the most parsimonious sequence of events using muta-\\ntions and copy number events.

De-\\nspite the profound clinical activity of BRAFis in\\nthis setting, the degree and durability of response\\nare highly variable.1-6 Prior studies have identified\\nmechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAFis,\\nmany of which have been validated using tumor\\ntissues collected at the time of disease progression.\\nThese resistance mechanisms can be divided into\\ntwo classes. Class 1 alterations confer drug re-\\nsistance by abrogating the ability of the drugs to\\ninhibit ERK signaling and include mutations in\\nNRAS, NF1, MEK1/MEK2, and BRAF splice\\nvariants.7-14 Class 2 alterations result in reduced\\ndependence on RAF signaling and include alter-\\nations that activate parallel pathways such as inac-\\ntivating PTEN mutations15-17 and alterations in\\ngenes that dysregulate the downstream machinery\\nthat mediates cell cycle progression (eg, RB1,\\nCDKN2A, CCND1)17-19 or apoptosis (eg, TP53,\\nMCL1).20 In addition, alterations that overcome\\nBRAF-mediatedfeedback-inducedsuppressionof\\nupstream receptor tyrosine kinases likely function\\nby both mechanisms.8,21-27\\nThe molecular basis of intrinsic resistance is less\\nwellcharacterized.

Patients had stage IV or\\nunresectablestageIIIBRAFV600E/Kmelanoma.\\nResponse was assessed using both Response\\nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1\\n(RECIST) and response grade, a composite mea-\\nsure of the average of the percentage of lesion\\nshrinkage and the duration of response.28 For re-\\nsponse grade, patients were segregated into the\\nfollowing three classes: excellent (> 50% tumor\\nshrinkage for > 7 months or any shrinkage for\\n> 12 months), poor (tumor growth, any new lesions,\\nor < 50% shrinkage for , 4 months), or interme-\\ndiate (neither excellent nor poor). Patients who\\ndied or were lost to follow-up before the first\\nassessment or who had incomplete imaging were\\ngraded as not evaluable. Progression-free survival\\n(PFS) was defined as the time from the start of\\nBRAFi therapy until the date of progression on\\nBRAFi, date of death, or the date of last follow-up;\\npatients who were switched to immune checkpoint\\nblockade were censored at the date of withdrawal\\nfrom BRAFi therapy. Overall survival (OS) was\\nmeasured as the time from the start of BRAFi\\ntherapy until the date of death; patients alive at last\\nfollow-up were censored at the date of last docu-\\nmented contact. The cutoff date was March 2016,\\nwith a median follow-up time for the entire cohort\\nof 14.6 months.\\nExon Capture Sequencing\\nDNA from tumor and blood was analyzed using a\\ncustom,exoncaptureDNAsequencingassaydesigned\\nto capture all protein-coding exons and selected\\nintrons of . 250 cancer-associated genes.29,30\\nSee Data Supplement for gene lists. Single nu-\\ncleotide variants were detected using MuTect,31\\nand indels were detected using the SomaticIn-\\ndelDetector tool in GATK. All candidate muta-\\ntions were reviewed manually using the Integrative\\nGenomics Viewer.32,33 Mean sequence coverage\\nwas calculated using the DepthOfCoverage tool in\\nGATK and used to compute copy number.29,30\\nThe FACETS algorithm was used to estimate\\ntumor purity, ploidy, and allele-specific copy num-\\nber.34 For correlations with responseand outcome,\\nwe restricted the analysis to a subset of 56 genes\\nselected based on their mutation frequency in\\nmelanoma and their ability to activate MAPK and/\\nor PI3K signaling (Data Supplement). All clin-\\nical and genomic data are available through the\\nMemorial Sloan Kettering cBio Portal for Cancer\\nGenomics (http://cbioportal.org/).\\nBiostatistics\\nA Kruskal-Wallis test and one-way analysis of\\nvariance were used to assess the association be-\\ntween mutations and response. Fisher’s exact t test\\nwas used to compare the percentage of mutations\\nfor each designated gene between The Cancer\\nGenome Atlas (TCGA) and Memorial Sloan Ket-\\ntering Cancer Center/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer\\nCenter cohorts. BRAF-mutant allele frequencies\\nwere z score normalized relative to allele fre-\\nquencies of other mutations in the same sample;\\ndeviation from the null distribution was com-\\nputed using a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test.\\nA Cox proportional hazards model was fit to\\nobtain hazard ratios (HRs) and P values for PTEN\\nmutation (Wald test) from univariable and mul-\\ntivariable models. Survival curves (OS and PFS)\\nwere obtained with Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla,\\nCA), and a P value from a log-rank test is\\npresented.\\nRESULTS\\nPatient Characteristics and BRAFi Response\\nWe analyzed pretreatment tumors from 66 pa-\\ntients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma.\\nForty-nine patients received vemurafenib, five\\ndabrafenib, and 11 a BRAFi plus MEK inhibitor\\n(MEKi) combination. Notably, in the BRAFi\\ntherapy group, one patient received cobimetinib\\n(MEKi) for the treatment of chronic myelomo-\\nnocytic leukemia 75 weeks after the start of BRAFi\\ntherapy.35 For this patient, the clinical response to\\nBRAFi monotherapy was only assessable before\\nthe administration of the MEKi. The clinical\\ncharacteristics of the two cohorts of patients are\\nlisted in Table 1. Approximately 50% of the\\npatients also received immunotherapy during\\ntheir treatment course (29 of 55 BRAFi patients\\nand three of 11 BRAFi plus MEKi patients),\\nwhereas 19.7% of patients received chemother-\\napy. Two (3%) of 66 patients had previously re-\\nceived the MEKi selumetinib before treatment\\nwith a BRAFi (Table 1).\\nObjective responses, as assessed by RECIST cri-\\nteria, to BRAFi monotherapy were observed in 30\\n(55%) of 55 patients, with five (9%) of 55 patients\\nachieving a complete response and 25 (45%) of 55\\npatients achieving a partial response.

Samples were sequenced\\nas outlined in Patients and Methods to a mean\\ncoverage of 622-fold, identifying on average nine\\nsingle nucleotide variants or indels per tumor\\n(range, two to 39 variants or indels; Data Supple-\\nment). We confirmed the presence of a BRAF\\nV600E/K mutation in all tumors. In contrast to\\npatients treated with immune checkpoint block-\\nade,36 no correlation was observed between the\\nnumber of somatic mutations and treatment re-\\nsponse (Data Supplement). BRAF amplification\\nwas observed in three tumors, all with intermediate\\nresponses. Although BRAF amplification has been\\nassociated with acquired resistance to BRAFis,37\\nthese data indicate that BRAF amplification does\\nnot preclude BRAFi response. An increase in\\nBRAF-mutant allele fraction relative to the mean\\nallele fraction of other variants identified in a\\nsample could indicate allelic imbalance resulting\\nfrom selective gain of the mutated BRAF allele or\\nloss of the wild-type allele. Significantly elevated\\nBRAF-mutantallelefractions(morethantwicethe\\nmedian of all variants detected in the sample) were\\nobserved in a total of nine patients (four excellent\\nresponders, four intermediate responders, and\\none poor responder; Data Supplement) in the\\nBRAFi cohort.

Quantitative\\nestimates of tumor ploidy and purity could be\\ncalculated for a subset of patients and confirmed\\nallelic imbalance in two excellent responders (Data\\nTable 1.

One patient had an alteration in NF1\\nthat would be predicted to result in loss of expres-\\nsion (X2441_splice). Consistent with preclinical\\ndata indicating that loss of NF1 confers resistance\\nto BRAFis,11,44 this patient had a poor response\\ngrade. MAP2K1 mutations were rare; only one\\npatient, an intermediate responder, harbored an\\nMEK1 mutation (P124S; Fig 3, left panel). A\\nsecond patient, an intermediate responder treated\\nwithaBRAFiplusMEKicombination,hadaknown\\nactivating mutation in MEK1 (Q56P) with an allele\\nfrequencyof0.04(comparedwith0.19fortheBRAF\\nmutation), consistent with the presence of a sub-\\nclonal population. Both the MEK1 P124S and\\nQ56P mutations have previously been shown to\\nbe associated with context-dependent resistance to\\nboth MEKis and BRAFis.12\\nWe observed mutations in RB1 or amplifications\\nin CCND1 in 11% of patients treated with BRAFi\\nmonotherapy; however, no association with re-\\nsponse was observed (Data Supplement). Three\\npatients had amplification of MITF, and consis-\\ntent with a prior report,15 MITF amplifications\\nwere observed exclusively in poor or intermediate\\nresponders. However, given the rarity of this\\nevent, this association did not reach statistical\\nsignificance (Data Supplement). Finally, four\\nmutations in KDR (kinase insert domain recep-\\ntor, VEGFR2)wereidentified, allinpatients who\\nexhibited a poor response grade (Fig 3, left panel,\\nand Data Supplement). Of these mutations, only\\none (VEGFR2 R1032Q) is a hotspot,45 whereas\\nthe others are variants of unknown significance.\\nBoth OS and PFS were significantly shorter in\\npatientswithKDRmutations(DataSupplement).\\nAlthough this association was statistically signif-\\nicant, given the small number of mutational\\nevents and the lack of functional data regarding\\nthe significance of these events, this association\\nshould be interpreted with caution.\\nDISCUSSION\\nBRAFis and MEKis are now US Food and Drug\\nAdministration–approved treatments for BRAF-\\nmutant melanoma. Prior studies of small cohorts\\nof patients who initially responded to BRAFis but\\nlaterdevelopedacquiredresistancehaveidentified\\nmolecular alterations that underlie acquired drug\\nresistance.7-14,46,47 In this study, we sought to de-\\ntermine whether pre-existent co-occurring alter-\\nations predict for intrinsic resistance to BRAFis.\\nAs the benefit with anticancer agents has been\\nshown to associate with both depth of response\\nand response duration, we also correlated the\\ngenomic findings with response grade, a compos-\\nite measure of tumor regression and duration of\\nresponse. We found that loss-of-function alter-\\nations of PTEN correlate with poor response to\\nBRAFis in BRAF-mutant melanoma. Further-\\nmore, we observed that patients with PTEN al-\\nterations had shorter PFS and OS compared with\\nthe PTEN wild-type cohort.\\nNotably, PTEN and other PI3K pathway alter-\\nations were identified in a small number of excel-\\nlent and intermediate BRAFi responders. This\\nobservation is consistent with prior clinical and\\nlaboratory studies that suggested that alterations\\ninPTENdonotprecludeanantitumorresponseto\\nBRAFis.9,17,18 The data also suggest that addi-\\ntional comolecular events likely cooperate with\\nPTEN loss to confer BRAFi resistance in patients\\nwho derive no clinical benefit from these agents.\\nIn sum, the results support the testing of PI3K\\ninhibitors in combination with BRAFi and MEKi\\nalone or in combination in patients with concur-\\nrent BRAF and PTEN alterations.48,49 Because\\ncomplete responses were infrequent even in\\nPTEN wild-type patients, coadministration of a\\nPI3K inhibitor could also result in further incre-\\nmental tumor regression or a longer duration of\\ntreatment response in patients who lack PI3K\\npathway mutations.\\nA notable observation from this study was a trend\\ntoward increased BRAF-mutant allele fraction in\\nexcellent responders. This allelic imbalance is con-\\nsistent with a relative gain of the mutant BRAF\\nallele. Because increased expression of wild-type\\nBRAF would be predicted to confer resistance to\\nvemurafenib, it is biologically plausible that loss of\\nthe wild-type allele leading to a decrease in the\\nacutoffofsixrecurrencesor\\nmore reported in the\\nCatalogue of Somatic\\nMutations in Cancer\\n(COSMIC) in at least two\\ntumor types was used to\\ndistinguish a recurrent\\nmutation from a rare event.\\nLight green indicates\\nnonrecurrent missense\\nvariant of unknown\\nsignificance; red indicates\\namplification; blue\\nindicates deep deletion;\\nblack indicates truncating\\ndeletion; and orange\\nindicates in-frame\\nmutation.\\n7\\nascopubs.org/journal/po JCO™Precision Oncology\\n\', metadata={\'pmc_id\': \'PMC7446400\', \'name\': \'Metastatic Melanoma (MSK, JCO Precis Oncol 2017)\', \'description\': \'Targeted sequencing of pre-treatment 66 Melanoma tumor samples. <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.16.00054">PubMed</a>\', \'publicStudy\': True, \'pmid\': \'32913971\', \'citation\': \'Catalanotti et al.

First, the size of the cohort was too small to\\ndefine associations between response and alter-\\nations in genes that are infrequently altered in\\nmelanoma. In addition, the current standard of\\ncare for BRAF-mutant melanoma has been shift-\\ningtoward coadministrationof BRAFiand MEKi,\\nand PTEN alterations may have less effect in\\npatients treated with the combination. A second\\nlimitation is that the approach used could not\\ndetect changes in the expression of genes such\\nas PTEN resulting from epigenetic mechanisms.\\nThere was also variability in the duration between\\ncollection of the pretreatment sample and the\\ninitiation of BRAFi therapy, and the molecular\\nstatus of some genes may have changed during this\\ninterval.Inaddition,onlyasinglepretreatmenttumor\\nsite was profiled, and thus, some alterations may not\\nhave been detected as a result of intratumoral or\\nlesion-to-lesion tumor heterogeneity. Given these\\nlatter challenges to the use of pretreatment tumors,\\nwe are now exploring the analysis of tumor-derived\\nDNA in plasma, which may better represent the\\nspectrumofmolecularalterationpresentinindividual\\npatients. Finally, broader sequencing methodologies\\nsuch as whole-genome sequencing may identify pre-\\ndictive biomarkers in genes not included in the\\ncapture-based approach used in this study.\\nIn summary, our results suggest that pre-existent\\nmutationsinPTENareassociatedwithpoorBRAFi\\nresponse and shorter survival in patients with\\nBRAF-mutant melanoma. Additional studies using\\nbroader analysis methods and cell-free DNA may\\nidentifyadditional molecular signatures of intrinsic\\nBRAFi resistance that could be used to guide first-\\nline combinatorial strategies.\\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1200/PO.16.00054\\nPublished online on ascopubs.org/journal/po on June 23, 2017.\\nA\\nWith BRAF Inhibitor\\n1.0\\n0.5\\n0\\n20\\nP < .001\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nWT\\nLOF\\nMissense/in-frame indel\\nWT\\nLOF\\nMissense/in-frame indel\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nExcellent (n = 17)\\nIntermediate (n = 15)\\nPoor (n = 19)\\nCDKN2A\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nExcellent (n = 17)\\nIntermediate (n = 15)\\nPoor (n = 19)\\nPTEN\\nP = .005 \\nB\\nC\\nD\\nP < .001\\n1.0\\n0.5\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nPTEN WT (n = 39)\\nPTEN mutation (n = 16)\\nPTEN WT (n = 39)\\nPTEN mutation (n = 16)\\nPFS\\nTime (months)\\nOS\\nTime (months)\\nFig 4.

While the identification of recurrent fusions of the MYB-NFIB genes have begun to \\nshed light on the molecular underpinnings, little else is known about the molecular genetics of this frequently \\nfatal cancer. We have undertaken exome sequencing in a series of 24 ACC to further delineate the genetics of \\nthe disease. We identified multiple mutated genes that, combined, implicate chromatin deregulation in half \\nof cases. Further, mutations were identified in known cancer genes, including PIK3CA, ATM, CDKN2A, SF3B1, \\nSUFU, TSC1, and CYLD. Mutations in NOTCH1/2 were identified in 3 cases, and we identify the negative \\nNOTCH signaling regulator, SPEN, as a new cancer gene in ACC with mutations in 5 cases. Finally, the identi-\\nfication of 3 likely activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor FGFR2, analogous to those reported in \\novarian and endometrial carcinoma, point to potential therapeutic avenues for a subset of cases.\\nIntroduction\\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare salivary gland malignancy \\ncharacterized by an indolent clinical course with multiple local recur-\\nrences. Even with effective local control, the majority of patients suc-\\ncumb to metastatic disease within a decade. Thus, there is a pressing \\nneed for new therapies fueled by improved insights into the biology \\nof the disease. Here we report the exome sequencing analyses of 24 \\ncases of ACC and the elaboration of the genetics of this rare cancer.\\nOnly a handful of point mutations in known cancer genes \\nhave been reported in ACC, including KRAS, BRAF, and TP53 \\n(1). Recent progress has come in the identification of a recurrent \\ntranslocation t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) resulting in the fusion of the \\nv-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) gene on \\nchromosome 6 to the nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) gene on chromo-\\nsome 9 in the majority of cases (2). However, the extent to which \\nother genes are contributing to the disease and thus constitute \\nadditional targets for potential therapeutic exploitation is not \\nwell characterized.\\n"), Document(page_content='Results and'), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nTwenty-three pretreatment primary ACC specimens, 1 local-\\nregional lymph node metastasis (Supplemental Table 1; supple-\\nmental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/\\nJCI67201DS1), and corresponding matching normal salivary \\ngland parenchymal samples were subjected to solution phase \\ncapture and next-generation sequencing of the coding exome \\nas well as evaluation for and validation of somatic mutations as \\npreviously described (3). The case series consisted of 19 that were \\nscored as positive for MYB activation and comprised a roughly \\nequal mixture of cribriform and predominantly solid histological \\nforms of ACC (Supplemental Table 1). The latter are associated \\nwith increased risk of local-regional relapse, distant metastases, \\nand poorer overall survival (4).\\nExome sequencing identified 312 somatic mutations, ranging \\nfrom 2 in PD3198a to 35 in PD3181a (Supplemental Table 2), \\nwith a mean of 13 mutations per exome, lower than that reported \\nfor most adult solid tumors thus far. The mutations comprised \\n182 missense, 59 silent, 14 nonsense, 45 frameshift, 6 in-frame \\ninsertion/deletion, and 6 essential splice site. There was no sta-\\ntistically significant difference between the average numbers of \\nsomatic mutations in different histological subtypes, nor between \\nMYB-positive and -negative cases. Recurrent losses of 1p36, 6q, \\n9p, 12q were noted from SNP arrays (Supplemental Table 3 and \\nSupplemental Figure 1), in agreement with previous work (5, 6). \\nA substantial proportion of cases with likely MYB activation also \\ndemonstrated breakpoints and copy number changes on SNP6 \\narrays at MYB and NFIB loci (Supplemental Table 3), potentially \\naccounting for a substantial proportion of the reported involve-\\nment of these regions.\\nSomatic mutations were identified in multiple known can-\\ncer genes (Figure 1) including a CDKN2A truncating frameshift \\nmutation. Further analyses of SNP6-derived copy number data \\nidentified 3 additional cases (Supplemental Table 4) with loss \\nof heterozygosity encompassing the CDKN2A locus where there \\nwas no apparent involvement of the nearby NFIB locus in a MYB \\nAuthorship note: Philip J.

These data would be consistent with CDKN2A play-\\ning a role in a proportion of ACC. We also identified a canoni-\\ncal activating mutation in PIK3CA (p.H1047L) and a missense \\nmutation in the ATM kinase (p.R337C). Arginine 337 is highly \\nconserved and amino acid substitution mutations, p.R337S/H/C, \\nhave been reported in colorectal cancer and B cell chronic lym-\\nphocytic leukemia (1). The pattern of recurrence and multiple \\nsubstitution is consistent with this mutation being likely onco-\\ngenic. Somatic truncating mutations were identified in SUFU, \\nTSC1, and CYLD, 3 cancer genes associated with germline suscep-\\ntibility to rare tumor syndromes as well as in the recently reported \\nsplicing factor cancer gene SF3B1 (7).\\nSomatic mutations were also identified in NOTCH1 and \\nNOTCH2 in 3 cases. NOTCH1 had a missense (p.F1702S) and \\nframeshift mutation (p.Y550fs*81) in 2 cases, while NOTCH2 had \\n2 truncating mutations (p.Q2308fs*5, p.E2420*) in a single case. \\nPhe1702 of NOTCH1 falls within a region frequently targeted in \\nT-ALL for activating mutations, while the truncating mutation is \\nupstream of reported activating truncations. Recent identifica-\\ntion of frequent truncating mutations in head and neck cancers \\n(head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSCC]) in this same \\nregion suggested that NOTCH1 can act as a tumor suppressor \\ngene (8, 9). The presumptive compound heterozygous truncating \\nNOTCH2 mutations in PD3189 are reminiscent of those reported \\nin Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (MIM 102500) (10), which are sug-\\ngested to be activating. Thus, the functional nature of NOTCH \\ngene mutations in ACC is not easily discerned from the muta-\\ntional pattern and may be different depending on the context of \\nother cancer mutations in play.\\nEvidence was also found for alterations of genes involved in \\nhistone modification and chromatin remodeling previously \\nimplicated in cancer. Somatic mutations have been reported \\nin ARID1A in clear cell ovarian, renal (ccRCC), transitional cell \\nbladder (TCC) and gastric carcinoma (3, 11–13), CREBBP and \\nEP300 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (14), and KDM6A \\n(UTX) in ccRCC and TCC (3, 11). Each of these genes had only \\ntruncating mutations identified, with the exception of a trun-\\ncating and missense mutation in CREBBP. The missense muta-\\ntion, p.R1446C, occurs in the KAT11 domain and Arg1446 is \\nexquisitely conserved through to plants, supporting its func-\\ntional importance. Three previous substitution mutations at \\nthis residue have been reported (1). Like ATM, the recurrent tar-\\ngeting of the same amino acid for multiple substitutions sug-\\ngests an oncogenic phenotype for these mutations. Truncating \\nmutations were also identified in MLL3, an H3K4 methylase \\nwith mutations previously reported in medulloblastoma and \\nTCC (11, 15), and in ARID1B, a component of the switch/sucrose \\nnon-fermentable chromatin remodeling complex (SWI/SNF) \\ncomplex like ARID1A with recurrent mutations recently identi-\\nfied in breast cancer (16). SMARCA2, which encodes the BRM \\nATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex was also implicated \\nby 3 somatic missense mutations. Also likely affecting chro-\\nmatin regulation were a truncating mutation in CHD2 (a chro-\\nmodomain helicase ATPase), an in-frame deletion in BRD2 (a \\nbromodomain protein which binds acetylated lysine residues of \\nhistone H4), missense mutations in ARID5B (an ARID domain \\nfamily member implicated in childhood acute lymphoblastic \\nleukemia; ref. 17) and KDM5A, an H3K4 demethylase and com-\\nFigure 1\\nSomatic mutations identified in known cancer genes, SPEN, and genes involved in chromatin biology.

Summing over the \\nentire exome series, 12/24 cases have mutations in genes directly \\ninvolved in chromatin biology.\\nOne important aspect of genomic studies of rare tumor types \\nis the potential identification of novel cancer genes that may be \\nprevalent only in those cancers, shedding light on facets of can-\\ncer biology that might otherwise remain obscure. In this regard, \\nSpen homolog transcriptional regulator (SPEN), an inducible \\ntranscriptional regulator on chromosome 1p36, was identi-\\nfied as a cancer gene in ACC with 6 truncating mutations in 5 \\ncases (all of solid histology) in the exome screen. SPEN encodes \\na transcriptional repressor with RNA-binding domains and is a \\nregulator of NOTCH signaling, forming a complex with RBP-J \\nto downregulate target genes in the absence of activated NOTCH \\nsignaling (18). In addition, SPEN interacts with SRA, an RNA \\nnuclear receptor coactivator, to repress nuclear hormone recep-\\ntor activity in the absence of ligand (19). All of the mutations \\nwould truncate the putative protein prior to the SPOC domain \\n(Figure 2A), essential for transcriptional repression and likely for \\nhomodimerization (20). Three of 5 cases had evidence for loss of \\nheterozygosity (LOH). One case (PD3195) was found to have 2 \\ntruncating mutations: presumptively a compound heterozygote \\nor 2 subclones consistent with there being no discernible LOH. \\nA fifth case, PD3189, had no LOH at the level of SNP6.0 resolu-\\ntion and was likely heterozygous. Thus, a simple loss-of-function \\nmodel is unlikely to be operative. Intriguingly, this case also had \\n2 NOTCH2 mutations as indicated above, suggesting a strong \\ndrive to abrogate NOTCH signaling. No clear correlation of SPEN \\ntranscript expression and mutation status was obtained from \\nquantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) data (Supplemental Figure 2) or \\narray-based data (data not shown) across all samples — with all \\nmutant cases demonstrating continued expression. Sequencing \\nof SPEN through a further 42 cases identified 2 additional SPEN \\ntruncating mutations (p.R1403*, p.Q3355*), both in solid histol-\\nogy cases, thus confirming the importance of SPEN mutations in \\na proportion of ACC in general and in the poor prognosis solid \\nhistology subtype in particular. We were not able to assess LOH \\nfor these 2 cases. Recent work has identified truncating SPEN and \\nNOTCH2 mutations in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (21). Of \\nnote, none of the SPEN mutations reported had evidence for loss \\nof the wild-type allele, similarly arguing against a simple loss-\\nof-function mechanism for SPEN mutation in this cancer type. \\nGiven the identification of SPEN and NOTCH mutations in ACC, \\nit is reasonable to suggest that deregulation of NOTCH signaling \\nis playing a role in a proportion of cases. These data suggest an \\nopportunity to explore NOTCH pathway targeting as a potential \\ntherapeutic angle in ACC.\\nOf particular interest from a potential therapeutic aspect was \\nthe identification of mutations in FGFR2, encoding a receptor \\ntyrosine kinase for basic/acidic and keratinocyte growth factors. \\nTwo mutations, p.Y376C and p.I389_V393>M, were identified in \\nPD3197a and PD3226a. The p.Y376C mutation is identical to that \\nobserved in Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome (MIM 123790), \\none of the autosomal dominant craniosynostotic syndromes char-\\nacterized by kinase-activating mutations in FGFR family members. \\nMutations at the paralogous residue in FGFR3, p.Y373C, give rise \\nto thanatophoric dysplasia type I (MIM 187600). Somatic p.Y376C \\nmutations have been reported in endometrial and ovarian carcino-\\nma (ref. 1 and Figure 2B). This mutation and analogous substitu-\\ntions have been shown to be activating through constitutive recep-\\ntor dimerization via creating unpaired cysteine residues resulting \\nin ligand-independent receptor activation (22, 23). The in-frame \\ndeletion occurs in the transmembrane domain and is likely simi-\\nlar by analogy with other activating mutations (22). Sequencing \\nof FGFR2 through a further 25 cases identified a p.K642R muta-\\ntion in the kinase domain identical to that described in Pfeiffer \\nsyndrome (MIM 101600), confirming the importance of FGFR2 \\nactivating mutations in a subset of ACC. There are currently sev-\\neral small molecule inhibitors of FGFRs in clinical trial. Indeed, a \\ntrial of one of these, Dovitinib, in ACC has recently opened (24). \\nIt would be of considerable interest to evaluate FGFR2 mutation \\nstatus in tumors of participants.\\nIn summary, systematic analyses of ACC genomics have uncov-\\nered the involvement of multiple cancer genes that are likely to be \\ncontributing to tumor development in the context of MYB activa-\\ntion. These data point to disruption of chromatin regulation as a \\nmajor factor in ACC development. Further, identification of SPEN \\nand NOTCH mutations implicate NOTCH signaling deregulation \\nin a proportion of cases. Finally, these analyses have identified \\nactivating mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 in a \\nproportion of cases, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic point \\nof attack on this rare but lethal cancer.\\nMethods\\nDiagnosis of ACC. The diagnosis of ACC was only made based on the pres-\\nence in any part of the tumor of a tubular and/or cribriform patterns, \\nregardless of the presence and extent of the solid component.\\nAssessment of MYB fusion status. MYB-NFIB fusion status was investigated \\nusing a combination of fusion transcript sequencing, qRT-PCR, FISH, and \\n3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′ RACE), as described previously \\n(25). The particular data supporting a scoring of MYB activation in any \\ngiven sample are given in Supplemental Table 1.\\nFigure 2\\nSPEN and FGFR2 are cancer genes in ACC.

Human \\nbreast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and \\nbreast tumour xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating \\ntumours8–10. However the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on \\nthe genomic clonal architecture of tumours has not been systematically examined at single cell \\nresolution. Here we show by both deep genome and single cell sequencing methods, the clonal \\ndynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic \\nhuman breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal selection on \\nengraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree from \\nextreme selective engraftment of minor (<5% of starting population) clones to moderate, \\npolyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature \\nof tumours experiencing modest initial selection. Through single cell sequencing, we show that \\nmajor mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the \\nmost abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we \\nshow that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting \\ntumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of \\nevolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically defined clonal \\npopulation dynamics will be highly informative for functional studies utilizing patient-derived \\nbreast cancer xenoengraftment.\\nTo evaluate xenograft clonal dynamics (see Table S1 for definitions of terms used) we \\ngenerated 30 xenograft lines by serially transplanting (up to 16 generations over 3 years) \\nbreast cancer tissue organoid suspensions from 55 patients (Table S2, Extended Figure E1, \\nFigure S1) into highly immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2rγ−/− (NSG) and NOD/\\nRAG1−/−IL2rγ−/− (NRG) mice11 (details in the Supplementary Information). We carried out \\nmassively parallel whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS) on DNA from xenograft \\npassages of 15 patient lines (10 primary tumour-derived and five pleural effusion-derived), \\nalong with matched patient tumour and normal DNA (47 samples total, median sequencing \\ndepth 45.1,Table S3).

We surveyed the \\ncopy number alteration (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) landscapes by Affymetrix \\nSNP6.0 array (Table S7, Table S8). The mutation load of somatic SNVs (range: 4.3–\\n27.7×103 genome-wide, 57-1040 in coding regions), CNA and LOH (34–67% of genome) \\nand SVs in the 15 tumour-xenograft series (Figure S2, Table S9, Figure S3) were consistent \\nwith previous genome-wide breast cancer studies4, 12–17, though low tumour cellularity \\nhindered mutation discovery in SA429 and SA496 originating tumours. Tumour-xenograft \\npairs displayed comparable nucleotide substitution patterns (Figure S2, Figure S4), \\nsuggesting mutational processes are maintained post-engraftment.\\nTo determine the extent of evolution in the SNV landscape, we first compared the genome-\\nwide variant allele prevalences (VAP, the proportion of aligned reads at the SNV position \\nwith the variant base, see Table S1) from WGSS data in xenograft relative to tumour (SA429 \\nand SA496 excluded due to low tumour cellularity). As expected, sizeable proportions \\n(range 53.0–92.9%) of high-confidence SNVs are shared in tumour-xenograft pairs, with \\nprevalences lying on a scatter plot diagonal indicating neutral dynamics (Extended Figure \\nE2a, Figure S5a, Figure S6). Strikingly, all 15 samples also show clusters of SNVs prevalent \\nin the xenograft while at or below the limit of detection in the tumour (range 6.5–32.1% of \\nSNVs, see e.g. SA494, SA495, SA499), and vice versa (range 0.2–19.4%, see e.g. SA494, \\nSA495, SA500), implying clonal selection on initial engraftment. Tumours and xenografts \\nfrom SA494, SA495, SA499, SA500 and SA530 also exhibited substantial differences in SV \\ncontent (Figure S7, Figure S3).\\nTo resolve clonal dynamics and genotypes, we applied a Bayesian clustering model \\n(PyClone4, 18) to SNV VAPs measured by targeted deep sequencing, accounting for the \\neffect of copy number, LOH status and cellularity. SNVs with co-varying estimates of \\ncellular prevalence (the proportion of tumour or xenograft cells bearing the mutation) across \\nall time points are grouped into putative mutation clusters (Table S1). Consistent with the \\nraw VAP measurements, several cases contained mutation clusters with high (75–100%) \\nprevalences in the xenografts and low (0–15%) prevalences in the tumours, implying \\nexpansion of initially minor clones to dominate the xenograft (e.g. clusters 3, 4, 3, 2, 8, 2, \\nand 2 in SA494, SA495, SA500, SA530, SA532, SA533, and SA535) (Extended Figure \\nE2b, Figure S5b). Other series (SA493, SA499, SA501, SA531, SA534, SA536) \\ndemonstrated non-neutral clonal dynamics but involving alleles occupying much smaller \\nproportions of total cellular populations. Interestingly, polyclonal population structure \\nspecific to the xenograft was observed after initial expansion in SA493, SA494, SA495, \\nSA500, and SA531, suggesting initial selection on engraftment remains permissive to \\nadditional clonal evolution (Extended Figure E2b, Figure S5b). Polyclonal engraftment was \\nevident in SA493, SA501, SA531 and SA532, suggesting multiple clones maintained their \\nfitness post-engraftment.\\nAnalogously, we analyzed clonal dynamics using CNAs as clonal marks, applying a \\nprobabilistic model (TITAN19) that infers CNA and LOH from WGSS data, accounting for \\nmixtures of tumour and normal cells and reporting estimates of mutation cellular prevalence \\nand mutation cluster membership (Table S10).

Notably, the predominant \\nclonal dynamic (minor subclone expansion in SA494, SA495, SA532 and SA533; \\npolyclonal engraftment in SA493, SA501) mirrored those seen in SNV space.\\nWe next asked how clonal dynamics differ after initial engraftment, using PyClone \\npredictions over serial passage generations spanning up to 3 years (Extended Figure E1). We \\ndistinguished statistically significant directional clonal dynamics by testing overlap of 90% \\ncredible intervals derived from Bayesian posterior probability distributions (Figure 1). Cases \\nshowing strongest clonal dynamics in the first engraftment passages (e.g. SA500, SA530, \\nSA494, SA535) exhibited more stable prevalence over subsequent passages. In contrast, \\ncases showing moderate initial clonal dynamics showed more dramatic subsequent dynamics \\n(e.g. mutation clusters 2, 3 and 8 of SA501), in some cases leading to gradual expansion of a \\nminor clone to dominate the xenograft over serial passages. We noted examples of all ER/\\nHER2 subtypes and primary/metastatic cancers evolving by these two different modes. \\nSome mutation clusters showed non-dynamic patterns over time (e.g. clusters 1, 4, 6 of \\nSA500, clusters 1–3, 5, 7, 9–10 in SA532, as well as the highest prevalence clusters \\nrepresenting putative ancestral mutations that remained invariant, as expected). For two \\ncases we noted preferential engraftment of initial transplants in MFP over SR site (SA496 \\n4/4 MFP vs 0/4 SR; SA429 2/4 MFP vs 0/4 SR, Extended Figure E1). However, transplant \\nsite changes in established xenografts were not associated with unusually strong clonal \\ndynamics (Figure 1, see SA495 X3-4, SA499 X3-4, SA429 X1-2, SA496 X1-2).\\nTo directly validate the population-based inference of mutation clusters and clonal \\ngenotypes, we carried out single cell analyses of cases SA494 (an example of extreme initial \\nselection) and SA501 (complex post-engraftment clonal dynamics). We performed \\nmultiplexed targeted re-sequencing of SNVs in 210 isolated tumour and xenograft nuclei, \\nusing microfluidic devices. We determined evolutionary relationships between nuclei by \\nBayesian phylogenetic inference20, deriving consensus genotypes for clades representing \\nhigh probability splits in the phylogenetic tree.\\nAs predicted by PyClone, two major clades emerge in the SA494 phylogeny, comprising \\ntumour and xenograft nuclei respectively, bearing mutually-exclusive sets of alleles in \\nadditional to a set of shared alleles (Extended Figure E3a, b, c, Figure S13). The ancestral \\nclone SNVs (PyClone cluster 1) are common to nuclei from both clades, while SNVs in the \\npredicted dominant tumour clone (cluster 2) and minor engrafting clone (cluster 3) are \\nrestricted to tumour and xenograft nuclei respectively (Extended Figure E3d, Genotypes A \\nand B). This confirms the ancestral relationship between tumour and xenograft, verifies the \\nexpansion of a very minor clone (<5%) while showing unambiguously that mutation clusters \\ninferred by PyClone represent major clonal genotypes.\\nPyClone analysis of SA501 (Figure 2 and Figure S12) revealed a dynamic and complex \\nclonal architecture, with gradual expansion of minor mutation clusters observed over \\nEirew et al.\\nPage 4\\nNature.

The \\nmajor mutation clusters and their gradual change in prevalence over time predicted by \\nPyClone were confirmed by the clonal genotypes of single cells from SA501 passages X1, \\nX2 and X4 (Figure 2b, Figure S13). Phylogenetic inference resolved the clonal genotypes of \\nfive major clades (Figure 2a, d), with cascading acquisition of mutations from parental to \\ndescendent clone (Figure 2e). Genotypes A and B belong to sibling clades defined by the \\naddition of cluster 5 and cluster 4 mutations, respectively, to the ancestral genotype defined \\nby clusters 1 and 8; Genotype C was derived from Genotype B with the addition of \\nmutations in cluster 7; Genotype D derived from Genotype C with the addition of mutations \\ndefined by cluster 2; and Genotype E from Genotype D with the addition of cluster 3 \\nmutations and loss of cluster 8 mutations (Figure 2a, d, e). The clonal dynamics measured in \\nthe population was reflected in the relative abundance of single cell genotypes in each \\nxenograft tumour (Figure 2f), mirroring bulk population predictions (Figure 2c). Both X1 \\nand X2 sampled nuclei show an admixture of clones defined by genotypes A, B, C, and D \\n(relatively rare in X1). Genotype E is confined exclusively to X4 nuclei, suggesting that by \\npassage 4, this clone had nearly exhaustively outcompeted its ancestor and sibling clones. Its \\neventual dominance is mirrored by the decline of Genotype A (initially present in X1 and \\nX2), suggesting the descendants of Genotype B outcompeted those of Genotype A over \\ntime.\\nTaken together, these single cell genotyping experiments combined with phylogenetic \\ninference have recapitulated population level PyClone predictions in a simple (SA494) and a \\ncomplex (SA501) clonal expansion model. Thus, single cell genotyping validates PyClone \\nmutation clusters as genomic markers of major clonal genotypes, while providing additional \\ninsight into the ancestral lineages of cell populations.\\nFinally, to determine whether directional clonal dynamics might be associated with \\ndeterministic as opposed to stochastic processes (such as random genetic drift), we tested \\nwhether similar clonal dynamics occurred when the same tumour population was multiply \\ntransplanted into different mice. In 4/5 series examined, parallel clonal dynamics of the \\nsame mutation cluster(s) were observed (arrows in Figure 3a, b and Extended Figure E4a, b: \\nSA501 2/2 replicate mice at passage X3 and 4/4 at X4; SA535 X1 3/3; SA532 X1 3/3, X2 \\n3/7 and X3 2/2; SA429 X2 3/5). These include reproducible expansions of initially minor \\nsubclones, implying a high likelihood of shared deterministic mechanism rather than \\nrepeated rare stochastic events (for example, arising from transplants close to limiting \\ndilution). In SA501 the same pattern (expansion of cluster 3 mutations mirrored by decline \\nof cluster 5 mutations) was independently observed in transplants at passage 2, 3 and 4 \\n(Figure 3a, 2B, 3B, 4A–D), suggesting shared clonal fitness but variable timing.

SA535 (Figure 3b) and SA532 showed \\nexamples of clonal expansion patterns replicated in related but different immunodeficient \\nmouse strains (NSG, NRG). To control against shared clonal structure imposed through joint \\ninference of the datasets, we also carried out independent PyClone analyses that excluded all \\nbut one transplant at each passage, and observed high correlations of inferred mutation \\nprevalences between same-passage replicates (Extended Figure E5; median Pearson \\ncorrelations 0.94, 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, 0.46 for SA501, SA535, SA532, SA429, SA496).

Expansion of minor subclones has been suggested in previous xenotransplantation \\nstudies using malignant epithelial10, 21–23 or hematopoietic24, 25 cells, without formal \\nresolution of the clonal genotypes or pattern of subsequent clonal dynamics. In contrast with \\npreliminary studies of xenoengraftment, we find correlated dynamics of clones defined by \\nSNVs or copy number aberrations as clonal marks. Expansion patterns are most often \\npronounced in the initial establishment passage, however in cases where initial clonal \\nselection is weak, subsequent evolution over passaging is more evident. Furthermore, \\npolyclonal sub-structure may emerge even in xenografts that have undergone a modest \\npopulation bottleneck on initial engraftment. These dynamic processes are not evident from \\nhistopathological or imaging characteristics, which remain broadly stable, consistent with \\nprevious reports8, 9, 23.\\nImportantly, we find that the population dynamics of genomically-defined clones are \\nreplicated when transplants are carried out in multiple mice, implying that the basis of \\nselection is non-random and likely closely linked to the particular mutation genotype (or \\nepigenotype) that defines the clone. The most parsimonious explanation for repeated \\nobservation of these clonal dynamics is that the clones are mostly pre-existing and variations \\nin clonal fitness explain the dynamic behaviour, as opposed to de-novo somatic mutation. \\nFurthermore, cases in which conversion from minor to dominant clone occurs monotonically \\nover multiple passages demonstrate that selective fitness can be persistent rather than \\ntransient. Thus, specific somatic genotypes are likely to act as genetic markers of clonal \\ngrowth and fitness advantages, yielding predictable and reproducible clonal dynamics. \\nDetermination of the precise aberrations that give rise to selective clonal fitness still faces \\nconsiderable challenges. In this regard, we believe that ascertainment of clonal dynamics \\nwill prove essential for fully informed future studies of drug response and tumour biology in \\nxenografts of human breast cancers.\\nEirew et al.\\nPage 6\\nNature.

Incidence and \\nmortality of this disease have been steadily increasing over the past decades (2). Importantly, \\nhysterectomy-corrected mortality rates are highest among Black patients and are two-fold \\nhigher overall than for White patients despite similar incidence (2–4), which represents one \\nof the largest racial disparities among common cancers (5).\\nEndometrial carcinoma (EC) is a clinically, histologically and molecularly heterogeneous \\ndisease. Two-thirds of cases are diagnosed at an early stage and are generally associated \\nwith a good prognosis (1). While endometrioid EC, particularly of low tumor grade (i.e., \\ngrades 1 and 2), is the predominant histologic type, the more aggressive subtypes of \\nserous histology and carcinosarcoma, which represent 15–20% of ECs, account for the \\nmajority of deaths (2,6). Studies have found that serous and carcinosarcoma histology are \\nmore prevalent in Black than in White patients (7,8), potentially contributing to disparities \\nin survival outcomes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) landmark study revealed that \\nECs can be classified into four molecular subtypes (9), namely i) POLE (ultramutated) \\nECs, characterized by POLE exonuclease domain hotspot mutations and very high tumor \\nmutational burden (TMB), ii) microsatellite instability (MSI)-high ECs with a high TMB, \\niii) copy number (CN)-high ECs with high levels of somatic CN alterations and recurrent \\nTP53 mutations, and iv) CN-low ECs, which lack the defining molecular characteristics of \\nthe other three molecular subtypes and are also referred to as of no specific molecular profile \\n(NSMP) (10). This molecular classification has proven to be both prognostic, with POLE EC \\nWeigelt et al.\\nPage 2\\nCancer Discov.

To date, comprehensive tumor-normal multi-gene sequencing studies \\nof ECs from self-identified Black patients have been limited (n=109 pan-cancer TCGA/ \\nPCAWG (11,12)).\\nAt Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) the Gynecology Disease Management \\nTeam (DMT) routinely offers clinical tumor and matched normal MSK-IMPACT \\nsequencing, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized targeted next generation \\nsequencing (NGS) panel encompassing up to 505 cancer-associated genes (13), to newly \\ndiagnosed patients with EC presenting for care. We leveraged this resource of an unselected \\nseries of prospectively clinically sequenced ECs to define the distribution of molecular \\nand histologic subtypes as well as the landscape of somatic genetic alterations affecting \\ncancer-related genes in ECs occurring in self-identified Black and White patients.\\nRESULTS\\nHistologic and molecular subtypes of EC in self-identified Black and White patients\\nFrom a total of 2,248 unique EC patients with high-quality FDA-authorized clinical tumor-\\nnormal MSK-IMPACT sequencing data from 1/2014 – 12/2021, those self-identifying as \\nBlack (n=259, 12%) and White (n=1,623, 72%) were included in this study (n=1,882, Table \\n1, Supplementary Fig. S1). The prevalence of patients of Hispanic ethnicity was similar \\nbetween the two groups (n=13, 5.2% Black vs n=92, 5.9% White, p=0.6; Table 1). The \\nvast majority of MSK-IMPACT sequencing assays were performed on the primary tumor \\nspecimen (n=222, 86% Black vs n=1,356, 84% White, p=0.3; Table 1).\\nWe first assessed the distribution of histologic types based on expert gynecologic pathologist \\nreview in this unselected group of EC patients from a large referral cancer center. While \\nalmost half of White patients had ECs of low-grade endometrioid histology (n=766, 47%) \\nfollowed by serous (13%), carcinosarcoma (11%), grade 3 endometrioid histology (11%), \\nand mixed/ high-grade not otherwise specified (NOS; 8.5%), Black patients more commonly \\nhad ECs of high-risk histology (p<0.01). Serous histology (29%), carcinosarcoma (20%), \\nmixed/ high-grade NOS (12%) and grade 3 endometrioid histology (6.6%) made up 68% \\nof ECs in Black patients whereas only 21% were low-grade endometrioid ECs (Fig. 1A; \\nTable 1). This difference in the distribution of histologic types occurring in Black vs White \\npatients was maintained when analyzing primary and recurrent/ metastatic ECs separately \\n(Supplementary Fig. S2A).\\nAkin to the difference in histologic types, the distribution of EC molecular subtypes was \\ndistinct. While the prevalence of CN-H/TP53abn (35%), CN-L/NSMP (34%) and MSI-H \\n(25%) molecular subtypes was similar in White patients, 69% of ECs in Black patients \\nwere of CN-H/TP53abn molecular subtype (Fig. 1B; p<0.001). In contrast, ECs of POLE \\nmolecular subtype, associated with a favorable prognosis (9), were found in 5.8% of White \\npatients but were rarer among Black patients (3/259, 1.2%; Table 1, Fig. 1B).

When TMB was assessed according to histologic type, a significantly higher TMB \\nwas detected in ECs from White than from Black patients in the majority of histology types, \\nincluding low-grade endometrioid (p=0.044), serous (p=0.005), carcinosarcoma (p=0.022) \\nand mixed/high-grade NOS (p<0.001); no difference in TMB in grade 3 endometrioid and \\nclear cell ECs was observed, likely due to the small sample sizes (Fig. 2C).

It is noteworthy that this difference in ERBB2 alteration incidence in \\nECs from Black compared to White patients was driven by an enrichment in ERBB2 gene \\namplification (12% vs 3%, q<0.001) rather than somatic ERBB2 point mutations (3% vs \\n3%; q>0.1).

In contrast, direct comparisons \\nby histologic type and molecular subtype revealed that TMB was lower in ECs from \\nBlack as compared to White patients, even within specific histologic subtypes or CN-H/\\nTP53abn ECs, whereas the FGA was similar. Gene level analysis of CN-H/TP53abn ECs \\nand carcinosarcomas, however, demonstrated a higher incidence of genetic alterations such \\nas CCNE1 amplification, associated with poor outcomes and chemoresistance (25), in Black \\nas compared to White patients.

For example, the TCGA study estimated 25–30% of ECs \\nexhibit an MSI-H phenotype (9), and although a similar prevalence was observed in the \\npresent study in ECs from White patients (25%), this rate was significantly lower in Black \\npatients (14%). MSI-H ECs show robust response rates to ICIs, and both pembrolizumab \\nand dostarlimab are approved in recurrent dMMR/MSI-H ECs. Recently, two randomized, \\nplacebo controlled, phase 3 clinical trials found that the addition of ICIs to standard \\nchemotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent EC resulted in significantly improved \\nprogression-free survival; most pronounced and practice changing in the dMMR/ MSI-H \\ngroup (30,31). Additionally, TMB is also a marker of response to ICIs, and pembrolizumab \\nis approved for unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with TMB ≥\\n10 mut/Mb (33). We \\ndetected a lower frequency of TMB-H in ECs from Black compared to White patients (15% \\nvs. 33%). Furthermore, our OncoKB analysis revealed that the frequency of a clinically \\nactionable alteration, namely MSI-H and TMB ≥\\n10 Mut/Mb, was significantly lower in \\nBlack vs White patients, potentially leading to disparate eligibility for available therapies. \\nImportantly, it has been recently shown that tumor-normal sequencing, like the MSK-\\nIMPACT assay employed in this study, is not related to an overestimation of TMB in Asian/\\nAfrican populations while tumor-only sequencing does (34). Our findings are consistent \\nwith prior studies showing differential TMB in non-gynecologic cancers of Black compared \\nto White patients, after adjustment for ancestry, and associations with immunotherapy \\nresponse (34). Although pembrolizumab with lenvatinib is approved in microsatellite stable \\n(MSS) EC, the addition of lenvatinib introduces more toxicity, including hypertension and \\nproteinuria (35). While rare overall, the POLE molecular subtype is associated with very \\nfavorable outcomes and susceptibility to ICIs (36), and only 1.2% of Black patients had ECs \\nof POLE molecular subtype. Further studies are required to understand the mechanistic basis \\nfor the low occurrence of good-outcome POLE ECs in Black patients. Our data suggest, \\ncollectively, that Black patients may have differential access to immune-based therapies \\ncompared to White patients as their tumors less commonly have molecular subtypes or \\nmarkers that confer the most benefit.\\nWe observed less low-grade endometrioid ECs, which are often hormonally-driven, and thus \\nfewer alterations in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in tumors from Black compared to \\nWhite patients, suggesting fewer Black patients may benefit from hormonal therapies or may \\nbe eligible for precision medicine trials targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway. In particular, we \\nfound fewer PTEN mutations in ECs occurring in Black patients in the overall cohort and \\nin those of CN-H/TP53abn molecular subtype as compared to White patients. In colorectal \\ncancer it has been reported that the PTEN mutation frequencies are highest in tumors \\nbearing POLE mutations (37). This is consistent with previous observations from our team, \\nwhere we found PTEN mutations most commonly in ECs of POLE (92%) and MSI-H \\nmolecular subtype (87%), compared to CN-L/NSMP (68%) or CN-H/TP53abn tumors \\n(16%) (38). One could hypothesize that the lower PTEN mutation frequency in ECs from \\nBlack patients may be associated, at least in part, with the lower occurrence of POLE \\nalterations.\\nIn contrast, we found more serous carcinomas and carcinosarcomas, corresponding to the \\nCN-H/TP53abn molecular subtype, in Black compared to White patients.

We noted that TP53 mutations tended to co-occur with \\nPPP2R1A and FBXW7 mutations in the ECs studied, while being mutually exclusive \\nwith genes preferentially recurrently mutated in endometrioid ECs (9), including KRAS, \\nARID1A and CTNNB1 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Black patients with EC have been reported \\nto be more likely to experience disease recurrence compared to White patients, even \\nafter adjustment for stage and treatment (39), and there is a need to precisely define the \\ndifferences in tumor phenotype to deploy effective targeted therapies and overcome this \\ndisparity. In addition, coupled with the higher prevalence of CN-H/TP53abn ECs, our \\ndata demonstrate that ECs occurring in Black patients have significantly higher rates of \\nERBB2 amplification (12% Black vs 3% White), although differences are not observed \\nwithin subtypes. Several anti-HER2 therapies, including trastuzumab, are now being added \\nto conventional chemotherapy for advanced serous ECs harboring HER2 overexpression/ \\nERBB2 amplification (40). Ongoing clinical trials are also testing novel anti-HER2 agents \\nsuch as antibody-drug conjugates (i.e., trastuzumab deruxtecan, NCT04482309), and clinical \\nactivity in previously treated patients with advanced or recurrent carcinosarcoma has been \\nrecently demonstrated, including those with low HER2 expression (41). Additionally, we \\nfound CCNE1 amplification, a marker of aggressive disease (25), to be more common \\nin CN-H/TP53abn ECs and carcinosarcomas of Black as opposed to White patients, \\nrepresenting a potential target in this aggressive histology that may benefit Black patients. \\nCyclin E1, the protein encoded by CCNE1, plays a role in cell cycle transition, and in \\ncells with TP53 inactivation, CCNE1 amplification leads to replication stress, chromosome \\ninstability and aneuploidy (42). Consistent with these observations, we found higher levels \\nof genomic instability as assessed by WGD and FGA in ECs of Black compared to White \\npatients. Several ongoing clinical trials are investigating targeted agents that capitalize on \\nCCNE1 amplification, including WEE1 and ATR inhibitor combinations and synthetically \\nlethal PKMYT1 kinase inhibition (43,44).\\nOur study has several limitations.

Histology re-review was \\nperformed by two gynecologic pathologists (L.H.E. and/or A.M.-B.) for ECs of ambiguous \\nor unclassified histology, and if unresolved, were categorized as ‘unclassified’, as described \\n(38). In addition, results of the immunohistochemical analysis of the DNA mismatch repair \\n(MMR) proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 were recorded. MMR-deficiency was \\ndefined by loss of expression of one or more MMR proteins in all tumor cell nuclei, in the \\npresence of an internal control (47).\\nGenomic data extraction, targeted sequencing analysis and molecular subtyping\\nThe MSK-IMPACT assay targets between 341 (2014) and 505 (2021) cancer-related \\ngenes (14,17). Genomic data extracted from MSK-IMPACT included somatic mutations, \\npathogenicity of somatic mutations as defined by OncoKB, CIViC and Cancer Hotspots \\n(23,48,49), TMB (Mut/Mb), MSIsensor score (50), tumor purity and fraction of \\ngenome altered (i.e., the percentage of the genome affected by copy number alterations)\\n(13,17,20,38). Variants of unknown significance (VUS), defined as alterations not classified \\nas oncogenic, likely oncogenic, or predicted oncogenic by OncoKB (23), were excluded \\nfrom the analysis. We used FACETS to define the allele-specific gene copy number \\nalterations (51), which were manually reviewed for the identification of amplifications \\nand homozygous deletions, tumor purity and ploidy, as previously described (52). Whole \\ngenome doubling (WGD) status was inferred from MSK-IMPACT sequencing data, as \\npreviously described (18). Briefly, tumor samples were considered to have undergone \\nWGD if the fraction of major allele > 1 was > 50%. For molecular analyses, only high-\\nquality samples were included, and those with a tumor purity of <20% or absence of \\nany somatic mutations were excluded (Supplementary Fig. S1), as previously described \\n(38). Molecular subtype assignment was performed using an integrated clinical sequencing \\n– immunohistochemistry approach, as previously described (38). ECs were defined as 1) \\nPOLE (ultramutated) based on the presence of a known POLE hotspot exonuclease domain \\nmutation (53) or POLD1 pathogenic mutation (54); 2) MSI-H based on a high MSIsensor \\nscore ≥\\n10 inferred from MSK-IMPACT sequencing (50,55) and/or MMR-deficiency based \\non immunohistochemistry; 3) CN-H/TP53abn based on the presence of a pathogenic/ driver \\nTP53 mutation or TP53 homozygous deletion; or 4) CN-L/NSMP based on the absence of \\nthe defining features of the other molecular subtypes. In addition, CN-L/NSMP and CN-H/\\nTP53abn ECs with a TMB above the median TMB of MSI-H tumors (i.e., >35 Mut/Mb) \\nwere deemed unclassifiable and excluded from further analysis.\\nMutual exclusivity, pathway and OncoKB analyses\\nMutual exclusivity analysis was performed using combinations of mutually exclusive \\nalterations (CoMET) with the use of a pairwise Fisher’s exact test to detect the presence \\nof significant pairs of genes (56).

Briefly, ADMIXTURE v1.3 (59) was run in supervised mode using the \\n1000 genomes project (1KGP) cohort (60) as reference to infer ancestral proportions of \\nAfrican, European, East Asian, Native American and South Asian populations. Patients with \\nan ancestral fraction of >0.8 for any single population were assigned that population label, \\notherwise they were considered Admixed. Ashkenazi Jewish (ASJ) ancestry was inferred \\nusing 282 additional SNP markers captured by MSK-IMPACT, and the sensitivity and \\nspecificity of the ASJ genetic ancestry inference was tested in >8000 cases for which ASJ \\nstatus was manually curated through genetic counseling, as previously described (14). For \\nvalidation, histologic types and molecular subtypes of self-identified Black EC patients were \\nobtained from the pan-cancer TCGA study (11), and compared to the distribution based on \\ngenetic ancestry of the same cases as described in Carrot-Zhang et al (15).\\nStatistical analysis\\nSummary statistics were used to describe the study population. Fisher’s exact test or \\nPearson’s Chi-squared test were used to evaluate associations between race and the \\ncategorical variables, whenever appropriate. Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon rank \\nsum tests were used to evaluate associations between race and the continuous variables. \\nComparisons of frequencies of genes altered by somatic genetic and CN alterations were \\nperformed using Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression. Multiple testing correction using \\nthe Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to control for the false discovery rate (FDR) \\nwhenever appropriate. All p-values were two-tailed, and 95% confidence intervals were \\nadopted for all analyses.\\n"), Document(page_content="Supplementary Material\\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\\nAcknowledgements:\\nWe gratefully acknowledge members of the Marie Josée and Henry R.

Recently, application of genome/exome sequencing and RNA-seq to DLBCL has revealed numerous\\ngenes that are recurrent targets of somatic point mutation in this disease. Here we provide a whole-genome-sequencing-based perspective of\\nDLBCL mutational complexity by characterizing 40 de novo DLBCL cases and 13 DLBCL cell lines and combining these data with DNA copy\\nnumber analysis and RNA-seq from an extended cohort of 96 cases. Our analysis identified widespread genomic rearrangements including evi‐\\ndence for chromothripsis as well as the presence of known and novel fusion transcripts. We uncovered new gene targets of recurrent somatic\\npoint mutations and genes that are targeted by focal somatic deletions in this disease. We highlight the recurrence of germinal center B-cell-re‐\\nstricted mutations affecting genes that encode the S1P receptor and 2 small GTPases (GNA13 and GNAI2) that together converge on regulation\\nof B-cell homing. We further analyzed our data to approximate the relative temporal order in which some recurrent mutations were acquired and\\ndemonstrate that ongoing acquisition of mutations and intratumoral clonal heterogeneity are common features of DLBCL. This study further im‐\\nproves our understanding of the processes and pathways involved in lymphomagenesis, and some of the pathways mutated here may indicate new\\navenues for therapeutic intervention.\\nIntroduction\\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with at least 2 molecular subtypes that demonstrate\\ndistinct clinical outcomes and gene expression profiles. Because these cancers derive from mature B cells, the mutations that arise in DLBCLs\\ncan result from somatic hypermutation that targets a small number of genes,  as well as structural rearrangements that arise from double-strand\\nbreaks that can be initiated by the B-cell recombination apparatus. In recent years, multiple groups have used massively parallel sequencing\\n(genome/exome sequencing and RNA-seq) to ascertain the full set of genes targeted by somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in this\\ndisease.\\n On the basis of these and earlier studies,  it is now known that the 2 molecular subtypes also harbor distinct repertoires of somatic\\ncopy number alterations (CNAs) and SNVs. In particular, mutations affecting genes involved in B-cell receptor signaling and nuclear factor κB\\nare common in the activated B-cell variety,  whereas those affecting certain genes with roles in histone modification may be more common in\\nthe germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype.\\nThese studies have confirmed that DLBCL is a genetically complex and heterogeneous disease and argue that a more complete understanding of\\nthe different mutation targets and mutational processes operating in this cancer is necessary. Previous studies have used mainly exome sequenc‐\\ning, which queries ∼1% of the genome, or RNA-seq to study DLBCL, but both methods are blind to the global patterns of mutation, as well as to\\nthe landscape of copy-neutral/balanced (or small) genomic rearrangements.\\n To address this deficiency, our study reports the whole-genome se‐\\nquencing (WGS) of 40 DLBCL tumor/normal pairs integrated with RNA-seq and copy number data from 96 tumors, and our analysis reveals a\\nrich collection of SNVs, genomic rearrangements, and fusion transcripts. Overall, these data reveal new genes of interest as well as previouslyff\\n1\\n2-5\\n6\\n7\\n2,8,9\\n2-5\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3744992', 'name': 'Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (BCGSC, Blood 2013)', 'description': 'Whole genome sequencing of 40 DLBCL tumor/normal pairs and 13 cell lines.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '23699601', 'citation': 'Morin et al.

Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration\\nof Helsinki. Raw sequencing data are available by application through dbGAP (study accession: phs000532.v2.p1).\\nSequencing\\nWe sequenced tumor and matched constitutional DNA (peripheral blood) from 40 de novo DLBCL cases, using Illumina WGS to achieve be‐\\ntween 27.9 and 56.6× average redundant coverage (median, 33.9×). These 40 cases are a subset of the 96 cases analyzed by copy number analy‐\\nsis (see below). To aid in determining the recurrence of mutations and identify suitable models for subsequent study of individual mutational\\nevents, we sequenced the genomes of 13 commonly studied DLBCL cell lines: DB, DOHH-2, Karpas422, NU-DUL-1, NU-DHL-1, OCI-Ly1,\\nOCI-Ly3, OCI-Ly7, OCI-Ly19, SU-DHL-6, SU-DHL-9, MD903, and WSU-DLCL2. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSequation\\n2000 platform, according to Illumina protocols, generating paired-end 100-bp reads using a combination of v2 and v3 chemistry and HiSeq\\nControl Software software versions 1.3.8 and 1.4.8.\\nSNV identification\\nSNVs were identified in genomes using SNVMix,  as described.

CNA information\\nderived from the WGS data (40 cases) and array-derived CNAs from the additional 56 cases were used for this analysis. To identify genes recur‐\\nrently mutated in DLBCL, we counted the number of cases in which each gene is affected by any focal mutation, including somatic nonsilent\\nSNVs, small (< 100 nt) somatic indels, small deletions/CNAs (< 50 kb), and chromosomal breakpoints of other rearrangements. For the break‐\\npoints of other structural rearrangements, any gene within 250 kb of either breakpoint was considered potentially relevant. When the relevant\\ngene was known (eg, BCL2, BCL6), other genes near that breakpoint were not considered. To integrate these different sources of data to collec‐\\ntively identify potential “driver” genes, a probabilistic model (DriverNet)  was applied. This method incorporates the above data types and path‐\\nway information to determine the mutations that are likely to result in perturbations to gene expression.\\nDuplication and mutation timing\\nEstimates of the relative time at which duplication events arose relative to somatic SNVs (“timings”) were computed using the approach de‐\\nscribed by Nik-Zainal et al,  based on computation of mutation ploidy by Greenman et al.  Calculation was based on integer copy number data\\nfrom cnaseq,  loss of heterozygosit (LOH) and allelic ratio data from APOLLOH,  pathology-derived normal contamination estimates,\\ngenome-wide SNV calls from SNVMix  and MutationSeq,  and allele count information derived using SAMtools.  Point estimates for the\\nproportional timing of all duplications in the DLBCL genomes were inferred from these data (supplemental Materials and methods). For each\\ntimed segment, 95% confidence intervals were computed, using a bootstrapping approach with 10\\u2009000 iterations of resampling the original muta‐\\ntions and recomputing timings. Copy number segments smaller than 100 kb were excluded from analysis. Duplications involving multiple se‐\\nquential events cannot be timed precisely and were approximated.

Priors for PyClone were set by giving equal prior probability to all genotypes containing at least a single\\nmutant allele that was compatible with the predicted copy number. Equal prior weight was also given to states in which cancer cells lacking the\\nmutation were predicted to have copy number 2 or the copy number of the mutated cells.

We observed nonrandom patterns of SNV distribution across the genomes with particular enrichment\\nnear transcription start sites, an observation that is consistent with aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM; catalyzed by AID), which we have\\ndescribed elsewhere.  Beyond this local variability in mutation rates, we also detected distinct mutational patterns and sequence contexts across\\nindividual patients. There was a broad range of overall somatic mutation load among the sequenced genomes, with the total number of candidate\\nsomatic SNVs detected per case ranging from 1165 to 48\\u2009385. We determined that the case with the lowest number of SNVs contained signifi‐\\ncant contamination from normal cells, and after excluding this case, we found an average of 12\\u2009086 somatic mutations (4.21 mutations/Megabase\\ngenome-wide) and 205.6 nonsilent mutations per genome (range, 35-400; supplemental Table 1). Despite the variability in mutation load, the\\nspectrum of SNV types and sequence contexts was largely consistent across cases, with some notable exceptions (Figure 1A; supplemental\\nFigure 1; “'), Document(page_content="Discussion”).\\nOur previous RNA-seq-based mutation screen  was insensitive to splice site mutations and was biased toward detecting SNVs in genes that were\\nactively transcribed in DLBCL, thus potentially restricting our ability to discover tumor suppressor genes. Despite the smaller cohort analyzed\\nhere, our selective pressure analysis of the SNVs detected in these 40 genomes identified 74 significant genes, including many of those reported\\nin our previous study  or subsequent exome-based studies,\\n while also capturing 41 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in\\nDLBCL (Figure 1B). To inform on the potential recurrence of mutations in any of the 74 genes in other data sets, we analyzed 13 DLBCL cell\\nlines by WGS and also mined the full data sets from other large DLBCL patient cohorts (supplemental Table 2).\\nThe pattern of mutations within individual genes can provide additional insight into the potential function of a gene as an oncogene or tumor\\nsuppressor and can also indicate the result of aSHM. Eleven of the newly detected genes had mutation signatures indicative of tumor suppressor\\nfunction with mutations at splice sites (eg, EBF1, RB1) or producing a truncated protein (eg, DNAH5). Some of these had low sequence cover‐\\nage in our previously analyzed RNA-seq libraries (supplemental Table 2), whereas others had mutated splice sites. Mutation hot spots within a\\ngene (eg, recurrently affecting a codon) are indicative of potential oncogenes, and these were observed in a subset of the genes detected. In the\\ngenes with signatures of aSHM (IRF4, IRF8, BCL6, PIM1, CD83, P2RY8, BCL2, and DUSP2), hot spots may reflect preference of AID for cer‐\\ntain sequence motifs rather than evidence of selection. The remaining genes with recurrent mutations and patterns inconsistent with SHM in‐\\nclude those with known dominant acting mutations in lymphoma (MYD88, CARD11, CD79B, and EZH2) as well as TBL1XR1, MEF2B, FAT4,\\nPKD1, NLRP5, and DSEL.

The recurrence of mutations in these genes was confirmed in many of the DLBCL cell lines (supplemental Table 3), but the potential function\\nof these mutations remains unclear. Other recurrent mutation targets included cell surface receptors mitigating interactions with T cells, such as\\nCD70  and CD83 ; purinergic receptors (P2RY8 and P2RX5), as well as cytokine receptors (S1PR2); and Gα subunits of G-protein-coupled\\nreceptors (GNAI2).\\nWe previously identified GNA13, another Gα protein, as a recurrent target of inactivating mutations in DLBCL  and noted that S1PR2 is a target\\nof aSHM.\\n As S1P  (encoded by S1PR2) can couple to each of these Gα proteins to regulate B-cell migration and homing (supplemental\\nFigure 3),\\n we further explored the mutation patterns in each gene (Figure 2 ; supplemental Figure 4 and supplemental Table 4). This analy‐\\nsis clarified the pattern that mutations affecting GNA13 were typically inactivating and confirmed that these mutations are strongly enriched in\\nGCB cases (P = 1.289 × 10\\n, Fisher’s exact test).

Coverage-based DNA copy number analysis showed that many of these breaks were associated with changes in copy\\nnumber state and also indicated copy-neutral events, including inversions and translocations. The number of individual events detected in a\\ngenome ranged from zero to 41 (supplemental Tables 1 and 5). The pattern of rearrangements and CNAs in some of the highly rearranged\\ngenomes is consistent with chromothripsis (Figure 4).  Separate cases included evidence for complex rearrangements resulting in high-level am‐\\nplification of the REL locus via a distinct mechanism (supplemental Figure 6 and supplemental Figure 7). Some of the deletions detected by as‐\\nsembly were below the detection resolution of CNA approaches (Figure 3B).

The second fusion joined the 3′ UTR of GAS2 to the second exon of TP63. The case involving TMEM110 included the\\n5′ UTR of TP63 and the bulk of TMEM110. We compared the expression of TP63 in cases lacking any fusion with all cases with fusions affect‐\\ning TP63 and found that the presence of a fusion correlated with increased expression of TP63 transcript (RPKM; P = .00378, Wilcoxon rank\\nsum test). The elevated abundance of TP63 transcripts in cases with this fusion has been previously confirmed by quantitative reverse transcrip‐\\ntion-polymerase chain reaction.  In one case, we identified 2 separate deletions affecting TP63. The larger deletion (∼363 kb) removed the first\\n3 exons that encode the larger TA-TP63 isoforms, whereas the smaller deletion (45 kb) removed the first exon of the shorter ΔN isoform, as well\\nas the fourth exon, which is shared by both isoforms (Figure 3B; supplemental Figure 12). The case harboring these deletions and 3 of the cases\\nwith fusions had evidence for monoallelic expression of TP63. Taken together with the elevated abundance of TP63 mRNA, this supports the\\nnotion that fusion with TBL1XR1 increases the abundance of TP63 message.\\nIntegrative analysis of distinct mutational modes and gene expression\\nAlthough some genes tended to be mutated by a single process, such as SNVs or small indels (eg, EZH2 and MLL2) or rearrangement/deletion\\n(eg, TP63), others were affected by a diverse combination of mutation types. To provide a more complete view of the genes affected by various\\nmutation types, we determined the number of times each gene was mutated in any modality (excluding large deletions; supplemental Tables 7-9).\\nThe genes most commonly altered include well-studied lymphoma-related genes such as CDKN2A/B, BCL2, and BCL6. Supplemental Figure 13\\ngives an overview of the prevalence and distribution of various mutation types affecting these and some of the additional commonly altered\\ngenes in the large cohort. Novel genes highly ranked by this approach include CDK11A, which was commonly lost by focal deletions or large\\ndeletions encompassing 1p36 (supplemental Figure 14); P2RY8 and CSMD3, each with a combination of SNVs and focal deletions; and\\nTBL1XR1. The involvement of TBL1XR1 in fusions with TP63,  focal deletions,  and SNVs  in DLBCL has been reported previously, and our\\ndata further support these findings. As a complementary approach, we performed an analysis that integrates the mutation data (CNAs, SNVs,\\nand indels) and gene expression information from the RNA-seq data to determine whether mutations result in perturbations to the gene expres‐\\nsion network in trans (“Materials and methods”). This analysis indicated that mutations in many of the 74 genes identified as significantly under\\nselection or commonly affected by other alterations might perturb gene expression in DLBCL (supplemental Figure 15).\\nDissecting temporal acquisition of mutations and clonal substructure\\nDetermining the order in which individual somatic alterations arise can provide insight into the roles of individual genes and mutations in onco‐\\ngenesis. One such method to approximate the order in which mutations arise involves comparing the clonal frequency of SNVs within a tumor.\\nWe and others have used this to determine the clonal (early) and subclonal (late) mutations in breast cancer  and leukemia.  By deeply rese‐\\nquencing a subset of the somatic SNVs detected in these genomes and correcting allelic counts for CNAs and LOH, we produced estimates of\\nthe cellular frequency of each of these mutations (“Materials and methods”).

A commonly held assumption is that important driver mutations are acquired early in cancer development, and thus would be\\npresent in all cells of the tumor.  Surprisingly, and counter to this, we observed multiple examples of well-characterized driver mutations, in‐\\ncluding hot spot mutations in EZH2, MYD88, CARD11, and CD79B, that were present in subclonal populations.\\nUsing WGS data, it is also possible to approximate the temporal ordering of copy number gains.  In cases in which both SNVs and large dupli‐\\ncations were present in the same tumor, we inferred the order in which these occurred (“Materials and methods;” supplemental Materials and\\nmethods).\\n We first focused on gains of the REL locus, as these are among the only common focal amplifications in DLCBL. We found\\nthat, similar to the known driver point mutations, REL amplifications can arise both early and late in tumor evolution (supplemental Figure 17).\\nWe next approximated the timing of all amplified regions in each of the 40 genomes (supplemental Table 10). This analysis showed that duplica‐\\ntions affecting chromosomes 18 (targeting BCL2) and 6p often occurred quite early in cancer development, whereas duplications of chromo‐\\nsomes 7 and 21 were among the latest events (supplemental Figure 18). Despite the trend toward earlier acquisition, we found examples of +18\\n(BCL2) and +8q (MYC) arising as late events in some tumors (Figure 5).  Other regions of amplification that were commonly observed are also\\nshown for comparison, along with candidate oncogenes indicated in each region.\\n"), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nPrevious publications exploring genomic sequences of DLBCL tumors focused only on the exonic portion of these tumors and the protein-alter‐\\ning SNVs. Together, the analyses presented here demonstrate, for the first time, the complete landscape of the diverse somatic mutation types\\nthat arise in a large number of DLBCL genomes. These data provide a global view of the variable mutation load and spectra that arise in DLBCL\\nand further support the widely appreciated view of DLBCL as a genetically heterogeneous disease. Overall, these data indicate that the average\\nmutation load in DLBCL is well above the level previously determined using exome sequencing in a small cohort.  There were clear outliers in\\nthis cohort with respect to mutation load and the spectrum of mutation types. For example, RG043 had nearly twice the proportion of TA>CG\\nmutations as the average tumor genome. This case also had the greatest mutation load overall, reaching almost 5 times the average across these\\ngenomes. Among these mutations, we found a single base indel in MSH3, which would result in a truncated protein. The association between\\nMSH3 inactivation and increased mutation rates has been described in colorectal cancer.  We noted that some of the other individual cases with\\ndistinct mutation spectra harbored mutations in genes encoding DNA polymerases (eg, POLE), but this observation was not consistent for all\\noutliers. Overall, there was a substantial positive correlation indicating that samples with higher numbers of mutations also have more distinct\\nmutation spectra (r = 0.69). Taken together, this suggests that unique mutational processes, resulting in an overall greater and distinct mutation\\nload, are active in a subset of these tumors.\\nDespite the small cohort size, our study has uncovered additional recurrent targets of somatic SNVs.

Although not yet confirmed in a larger\\ncohort, mutations affecting GNAI2 and S1PR2 (including the deletion shown in Figure 3) were restricted to GCB cases in our cohort of 96 pa‐\\ntients. Interestingly, GNAI2 had a mutation pattern distinct from GNA13, with an apparent enrichment for missense mutations rather than trun‐\\ncating mutations. Some of the residues we found mutated in GNAI2 are orthologous to gain-of-function mutations that have been characterized\\nin GNAI3 (supplemental Figure 4), and thus could be comparable to the oncogenic GNAS mutations common among pituitary tumors  and pan‐\\ncreatic adenocarcinoma.\\nGiven the potential for activating mutations in GNAI2, we predict that each of the mutations observed in these 3 genes has an equivalent effect\\non the signaling events downstream of S1P . In B cells, S1P concentration gradients are detected by S1P  and serve to restrict cells to germinal\\ncenters.  Signaling of S1P  through G  and Gα  has distinct effects on Rho and Rac activity, and each protein has an opposing effect on\\nPI(3)K/Akt signaling, with Gα  leading to suppressed Akt activity and G  promoting Akt.  Recently, recurrent mutations in RHOA have also\\nbeen observed in Burkitt lymphoma,  which is another cancer known to commonly harbor GNA13 mutations.  Although RHOA was not signif‐\\nicantly mutated in this study, we note the presence of a single somatic mutation in our patient cohort (R68P) and a second mutation in the cell\\nline OCI-Ly19 (Y66N). Together, these data further affirm an oncogenic role of perturbations to Rho-mediated B-cell migration or the indirect\\neffect these pathways have on PI(3)K/Akt signaling, particularly within the GCB subgroup of DLBCL.\\nBeyond SNVs, our integrative analyses highlight the many genes and pathways mutated by other mechanisms, including many known to be im‐\\nportant for DLBCL such as modulators of cell cycle and both p53 and Rb signaling (supplemental Figure 15). Although deletions affecting\\nCDKN2A/B, RB1, and TP53 have all been described,  splice site mutations affecting RB1, which we observed at high prevalence (7.5%), are a\\nnovel observation. Similarly, loss of CDKN2A by chromothripsis has not, to our knowledge, been described. In addition to these, we have identi‐\\nfied TAF1 as a target of both nonsilent somatic SNVs and high-level amplifications (Figures 1; supplemental Figure 5). TAF1 encodes a tran‐\\nscription factor with both histone acetyltransferase and kinase activities, and the latter is regulated directly by Rb.  In addition to its role as a\\ngeneral transcription factor, TAF1 regulates p53 activity by phosphorylating it at Thr55, thereby inducing its cytoplasmic shuttling and MDM2-\\nmediated degradation.\\n Given the prevalence of somatic events affecting both RB1 and TAF1 in this cohort, the role of these mutations in p53\\nsignaling and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention should be further investigated.\\nFinally, these data provided an unprecedented opportunity to explore the relative temporal order of mutation acquisition in tumors. We explored\\nthe focal amplification of the REL locus in detail. Although REL amplification appeared to commonly arise early in cancer development, we also\\nfound evidence for continued increases in REL copy number over protracted time and even observed REL amplification quite late in some cases.\\nIn contrast, amplifications encompassing the BCL2 locus were more typically acquired early in tumorigenesis, in line with the widely held view\\nthat BCL2 deregulation is an early event in transformation. Nonetheless, we also provide counterexamples in which amplification of BCL2 and\\nMYC arose later in tumor development, supporting that these genes can contribute to tumor progression even if not acquired early.

Guided by the prevalence of GNA13 mutations in our DLBCL cohorts analyzed by RNA-seq and WGS, we sought to as‐\\ncertain the full mutational landscape of this gene across a large number of de novo DLBCL cases (n = 279), of which 182 had been classified as GCB or non-GCB using immunohis‐\\ntochemistry.  (A) Nonsilent SNVs, indels, or splice site mutations were detected in a total of 40 patients (14.3%), with many cases harboring more than a single mutation. Up to five\\nnonsilent mutations affecting GNA13 were observed in one patient. Overall, multiple truncation inducing mutations including frameshift indels and introduced stop codons were ob‐\\nserved. The ratio of transitions to transversions and the large number of mutations affecting the WRCY/RGYW motif is consistent with AID-mediated mutation; however, there was\\nno observable enrichment of mutations in the 5ʹ end of the locus (supplemental Table 5). In agreement with our previous observation, GNA13 mutations were strongly enriched in\\nGCB, with 29 of 89 GCB (32.6%) cases having at least a single mutation in this gene and only 2 of 91 non-GCB cases mutated.

After induction, 26 patients were \\neligible for HDC-ASCT and 21 agreed to proceed. There were no unexpected adverse events or toxic deaths. \\nAfter median follow-up of 66\\xa0months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) for transplanted patients was 86%, \\n5-year PFS 60%, and no patient has died. Among all 1p/19q codeleted patients (N =\\xa033), 5-year PFS was 50% \\nand 5-year overall survival (OS) 93%, with median time to radiotherapy not reached. Next-generation sequenc-\\ning disclosed typical oligodendroglioma-related mutations, including IDH1, TERT, CIC, and FUBP1 mutations in \\n1p/19q codeleted patients, and glioblastoma-like signatures in 1p/19q intact patients.

Chemotherapy of oligodendroglioma\\nNeuro-\\nOncology\\nImportance of the\\xa0study\\nMulticenter studies of radiation and procarbazine, \\nlomustine, and vincristine chemotherapy have dem-\\nonstrated median survivals of greater than 14\\xa0 years \\nfor anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. In long-term sur-\\nvivors, the late neurocognitive side effects of radia-\\ntion therapy are a concerning sequela of treatment. In \\nthis multicenter study mostly enrolling patients with \\n1p/19q codeleted tumors, we investigated a chemother-\\napy-only approach of TMZ followed by myeloablative \\nchemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue as an \\nalternative to radiochemotherapy-based treatment. We \\nfound acceptable side effects and survival after 5\\xa0years, \\nso far comparable to other studies of 1p/19q codeleted \\npatients. Our findings suggest that a chemotherapy-\\nonly approach may delay the use of radiation therapy \\nand associated morbidity while maintaining survival. \\nWe also provide a comprehensive genomic characteri-\\nzation of oligodendroglial tumors, to be made publicly \\navailable along with clinical data and which can be used \\nto guide future studies.\\nAnaplastic oligodendrogliomas, both pure (AO) and \\nmixed anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (AOA), are uncom-\\nmon primary brain tumors that are uniquely sensitive \\nto chemotherapy.1–3 While surgery and radiation therapy \\n(RT) may prolong life in many high grade gliomas,4 adju-\\nvant chemotherapy may be especially effective in anaplas-\\ntic oligodendroglial tumors with loss of heterozygosity of \\nchromosomes 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeleted).5,6 \\nTwo large \\nrandomized phase III studies of RT with or without adju-\\nvant chemotherapy with procarbazine, lomustine, and \\nvincristine (PCV) demonstrated significant improvement \\nin progression-free survival (PFS) and near doubling of \\noverall survival (OS) to greater than 14\\xa0 years in 1p/19q \\ncodeleted tumors treated with adjuvant RT and PCV.5,6 \\nThe question remains whether chemotherapy alone can \\neffectively treat these tumors, thereby delaying RT and \\nits associated neurotoxic effects until relapse or progres-\\nsion. \\nThe risk of radiotherapy-induced late-delayed neuro-\\ntoxicity is particularly relevant in oligodendroglial tumors \\nbecause of its cumulative nature over time, potentially \\ncompromising long-term survivors’ quality of life over \\ndecades.\\nOur group has been interested in exploring high-dose, \\nmyeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous \\nstem cell transplant (ASCT) in newly diagnosed AO.3,7\\n,8 \\nThe rationale for this approach is based on (i) the known \\nchemosensitivity of oligodendroglial tumors, (ii) the pos-\\nsibility of overcoming the blood‒brain barrier to achieve \\nhigher CNS drug concentrations, (iii) theoretical increased \\nactivity on cancer stem cells, and (iv) emerging evidence \\nof an increased antitumor immune response deriving \\nfrom a reprogramming of \\nT cells following immune recon-\\nstitution.9,10 This group previously reported on a phase \\nII trial in AO (N =\\xa0 69) utilizing dose-intensive PCV, fol-\\nlowed by high-dose thiotepa and ASCT in those patients \\nwith chemosensitive disease. The median PFS among \\n39 transplanted patients was 78\\xa0months and median OS \\nwas not reached, after a median follow-up of 81\\xa0months. \\nSubsequently, the group reported on a trial of 20 patients \\nwith newly diagnosed AO treated with intensive PCV and a \\nmodified myeloablative regimen with high-dose thiotepa \\nand busulfan.7 Preliminary results showed that among the \\n11 transplanted patients, the median PFS was 78\\xa0months \\nand the median OS was not reached. Across both studies, \\nno evidence of delayed neurotoxicity or myelodysplasia \\nhas been observed.\\nAs an extension of this work, and based on the emerg-\\ning evidence of temozolomide (TMZ) activity in this dis-\\nease,11–13 we conducted a multicenter phase II study in \\nnewly diagnosed AO and AOA utilizing \\nTMZ instead of PCV \\nas initial chemotherapy and maintaining the same thiotepa/\\nbusulfan myeloablative regimen and ASCT\\n. Our objective \\nwas to determine whether such a regimen could result \\nin long-term control, potentially delaying or eliminating \\nthe need for RT\\n.

Chemotherapy of oligodendroglioma\\nNeuro-\\nOncology\\nsignatures between 1p/19q codeleted and 1p/19q intact \\ntumors. The gene signatures observed in 1p/19q intact \\ntumors were suggestive of “de novo” glioblastoma-like \\nsignatures,21 with wild-type IDH1 and 2, and mutations \\nin EGFR, NF1, and MDM2. No patient displayed an IDH1 \\nmutant astrocytoma signature, suggesting that the risk \\nin the interpretation of pathology findings in oligoden-\\ndroglial tumors is to miss a diagnosis of glioblastoma, \\nrather than other IDH1 mutant tumors. Interestingly, one \\nof the patients with 1p/19q codeletion on FISH who died \\nearly at 13\\xa0months was found to have a glioblastoma-like \\nsignature on gene sequencing, with IDH1 and 2 wild type \\nand PTEN loss, indicating false-positive FISH results. This \\nsuggests that gene sequencing may constitute a more reli-\\nable tool to identify 1p/19q codeleted tumors25 than FISH, \\nand should be considered as a screening tool in future tri-\\nals, especially for those cases where upfront RT is to be \\ndeferred.\\nAs part of the genomic characterization in this trial, we \\nalso sought to determine the frequency of potentially \\nactionable mutations for which there are existing targeted \\nagents. In addition to IDH1 and 2 mutations, potentially \\nactionable mutations were found in a wide variety of genes \\n(Table\\xa0 4), including CDK4 amplification and TSC1 and \\nPIK3CA mutation, although no one leading abnormality \\nwas observed in terms of frequency. \\nThis highlights a feasi-\\nbility issue in the development of future treatments for oli-\\ngodendroglial tumors, with each actionable mutation only \\nfound in very rare patients. Enrolling such patients in so-\\ncalled basket trials, which allow for inclusion of different \\ncancer types sharing the same mutation, may be a more \\nrealistic path for investigating new targeted agents in this \\ndisease.\\nThis study was modeled after our previous study, in which \\npatients were given 3–4 cycles of PCV chemotherapy fol-\\nlowed by ASCT\\n.7 A\\xa0major controversy in the treatment of \\noligodendroglial tumors is whether single-agent TMZ can \\nbe used instead of PCV, which has been historically the best \\nstudied chemotherapy regimen in this disease but is fairly \\ntoxic. Although not an objective of our study, we conducted \\nan exploratory analysis and compared results of this study \\nwith our previous cohort of patients treated with PCV. The \\nlimitations of such comparison are considerable, including \\nsmall number of patients, differing length of follow-up, and \\nlack of randomization. Regardless, we found no evidence \\nof diminished efficacy, but rather an opposite trend, with \\npatients treated in the TMZ cohort faring better. It must be \\nnoted, however, that our cohort received a multidrug mye-\\nloablative regimen and these results may not be generaliz-\\nable to TMZ single agent without transplant. The long-term \\nsurvival data from the NOA-04 study of chemotherapy ver-\\nsus RT for newly diagnosed anaplastic glioma found longest \\nsurvival in patients initially treated with PCV chemotherapy \\nalone (N =\\xa017), followed by RT (N =\\xa035), and then shortest \\nsurvival in patients treated with \\nTMZ (N =\\xa016). While limited \\nby the small number of patients, this raises the question of \\nwhether delivering a line of treatment containing a multid-\\nrug regimen may be important in this disease.26\\nPatients with 1p/19q codeletion may survive dec-\\nades with disease. With long-term survival, late-\\ndelayed side effects of treatment become a relevant \\nconcern, particularly RT\\n-related neurotoxicity. The seque-\\nlae of cranial irradiation often appear months to years \\nafter treatment and most commonly manifest as cog-\\nnitive impairment, and in some cases may include neu-\\nroendocrine disorders, cerebral necrosis, and full-blown \\ndementia. In our study, when all 1p/19q patients are con-\\nsidered, the median PFS of 63\\xa0 months seems compa-\\nrable to RT alone but inferior to RT combined with PCV \\n(Table\\xa03). This translated into an RT\\n-free survival of 82% \\nat 2\\xa0years and 52% at 5\\xa0years. With an OS that to date is \\ncomparable, if not superior, to RT/PCV studies, our study \\nsuggests that salvage RT may be an effective treatment \\nfor these patients, and an upfront chemotherapy-alone \\napproach a viable alternative to defer radiation. Other \\nstudies of chemotherapy-alone approaches also seem to \\nsuggest comparable OS (Table\\xa0 3). However, preliminary \\nresults of a randomized trial of 12 patients treated with \\nTMZ alone versus 24 patients treated with RT with or \\nwithout TMZ favored the RT arms, leading to discontinu-\\nation of the TMZ-alone arm in a newly redesigned study \\n(CODEL, NCT00887146).27 Considering the small number \\nof patients and the fact that results in these 12 patients \\nseem an outlier compared with other prospective studies \\nof chemotherapy-alone approaches (Table\\xa0 3), such deci-\\nsion may have been questionable.\\nOur study has some limitations. (1) Although we report \\non a follow-up that now spans more than 5 years, contin-\\nuous assessment of survival is still needed to fully charac-\\nterize later endpoints. In addition to survival, prospective \\ncollection of imaging data beyond progression to charac-\\nterize response and patterns of progression following sal-\\nvage RT would have been of interest, but this was not part \\nof the original study design. (2) While neurotoxicity has \\nnot been reported in progression-free patients, formal \\nneuropsychological evaluation was not performed. (3) \\nThe trial did not include evaluation of \\nT\\n-cell repertoire and \\nother correlative studies to elucidate a potential increase \\nin antitumor immunologic response, a question particu-\\nlarly relevant given the disproportionally favorable OS \\nresults compared with PFS. (4) Although comparable to \\nor larger than other studies of 1p/19q codeleted tumors \\n(Table 3), the number of patients remains relatively \\nsmall, and inherent to transplant studies, some patients \\nrefused treatment. Because available trials are all small, \\nlarger meta-analyses would be helpful to test and gener-\\nate hypotheses, especially when coupled with genomic \\ndata. To this end, raw results of this trial, including both \\ngenomic characterization and clinical data, will be made \\npublicly available upon publication of this manuscript at \\nour institutional database portal Cbioportal,28,29 available \\nat http://cbioportal.org/study?id=odg_msk_2017\\n, accessed \\n6 January 2017\\n.\\nIn summary, we found that TMZ followed by HDC and \\nASCT can be safely administered to patients with newly \\ndiagnosed 1p/19q codeleted AOs, with promising PFS \\nand OS survival. Whether myeloablative chemotherapy \\nwith ASCT confers any advantage over other multidrug \\nchemotherapy regimens remains to be seen. Nevertheless, \\nresults suggest that further exploration of chemotherapy-\\nonly approaches in oligodendrogliomas remains an impor-\\ntant avenue of investigation.\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC5596171', 'name': 'Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma and Anaplastic Oligoastrocytoma (MSK, Neuro Oncol 2017)', 'description': 'IMPACT sequencing of 22 Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma and Anaplastic Oligoastrocytomas.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '28472509', 'citation': 'Thomas et al.

We identiﬁed 47 epidermal growth factor receptor/BRAF\\ninhibitor-naive CRC patients with dual RAS hotspot/BRAF V600E mutations (CRC-DD) from a cohort of 4,561 CRC\\npatients with clinical next-generation sequencing results. We aimed to deﬁne the molecular phenotypes of the\\nCRC-DD and to test if the dual RAS hotspot/BRAF V600E mutations coexist within the same cell.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS We developed a single-cell genotyping method with a mutation detection rate of\\n96.3% and a genotype prediction accuracy of 92.1%. Mutations in the CRC-DD cohort were analyzed for\\nclonality, allelic imbalance, copy number, and overall survival.\\nRESULTS Application of single-cell genotyping to four CRC-DD revealed the co-occurrence of both mutations in the\\nfollowing percentages of cells per case: NRAS G13D/KRAS G12C, 95%; KRAS G12D/NRAS G12V, 48%; BRAF\\nV600E/KRAS G12D, 44%; and KRAS G12D/NRAS G13V, 14%, respectively. Allelic imbalance favoring the oncogenic\\nallele was less frequent in CRC-DD (24 of 76, 31.5%, somatic mutations) compared with a curated cohort of CRC with\\na single-driver mutation (CRC-SD; 119 of 232 mutations, 51.3%; P = .013). Microsatellite instability–high status was\\nenriched in CRC-DD compared with CRC-SD (23% v 11.4%, P = .028). Of the seven CRC-DD cases with multi-\\nregional sequencing, ﬁve retained both driver mutations throughout all sequenced tumor sites. Both CRC-DD cases\\nwith discordant multiregional sequencing were microsatellite instability–high.\\nCONCLUSION Our ﬁndings indicate that dual-driver mutations occur in a rare subset of CRC, often within the\\nsame tumor cells and across multiple tumor sites. Their presence and a lower rate of allelic imbalance may be\\nrelated to dose-dependent signaling within the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.\\nJCO Precis Oncol 6:e2100365. © 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\\nINTRODUCTION\\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common\\ncancer in the United States, with nearly 150,000 new\\ncases each year.1 Approximately 60% of CRC cases\\nare driven by hotspot driver mutations in the mitogen-\\nactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway including\\nKRAS/NRAS hotspots and BRAF V600E mutations.2,3\\nThese alterations generally occur in a mutually ex-\\nclusive nature,4,5 and management of advanced CRC\\nis dependent on the mutation status of these genes:\\nPatients with advanced CRC with wild-type RAS are\\neligible for cetuximab or panitumumab, whereas pa-\\ntients with BRAF p.V600E–mutant CRC are eligible for\\ncombination therapy with encorafenib and cetuximab.6\\nThe coexistence of two RAS hotspot/BRAF V600E mu-\\ntations has been described but not systematically\\nstudied.7 It is also known that under selection pressure,\\nsuch as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or\\nanti-BRAF combination therapy, multiple MAPK pathway\\ndriver mutations emerge.8 Experimental models have\\nsuggested that resistance alterations are likely already\\npresent at low frequency before treatment exposure.9\\nMore recently, it has been suggested that multiple RAS\\nmutations in CRC should be treated as separate primaries\\nand hypothesized that these follow parallel evolution.\\nHere, we deﬁned the clinicopathologic and molecular\\ncharacteristics of dual RAS hotspots and BRAF\\np.V600E hotspot mutations from a large, well-curated\\ncohort of targeted therapy-naive CRC (herein referred to\\nas CRC-DD).

CRC-DD samples were more often pri-\\nmary tumors (89.3%) compared with CRC-SD (59.4%;\\nP = .0001; Fig 1A). Of these, 32 harbored dual KRAS/KRAS\\nmutations, 11 harbored dual KRAS/NRAS mutations, two\\nharbored KRAS/BRAF V600E mutations, one harbored an\\nNRAS/BRAF V600E mutation, and one case harbored dual\\nNRAS/NRAS mutations (Fig 1A). CRC-DD demonstrated\\nhigher rates of subclonal RAS hotspot mutations in com-\\nparison with CRC-SD (Fig 1B). The frequency of BRAF\\nV600E mutations in CRC-DD was lower than that in CRC-\\nSD: 3% versus 13.3%, respectively (P = .0058). Median\\nage at diagnosis (56 v 54 years, P = .23) and proximal\\ntumor location prevalence (53% v 47%, P = .43) did not\\ndiffer signiﬁcantly between CRC-DD and CRC-SD. Forty-\\nthree CRC-DD cases were adequate for clonality analyses\\nusing FACETS. Four groups of CRC-DD were observed after\\nclonality prediction: (1) both mutations clonal (nine cases,\\n21%), (2) one mutation clonal and one mutation subclonal\\n(17 cases, 40%), (3) both mutations subclonal (eight\\ncases, 19%), and (4) with one or more indeterminate CCFs\\n(nine cases, 21%; Fig 1C). Four cases (9%) showed one\\natypical KRAS V14I mutation in combination with a typical\\nKRAS mutation (Data Supplement).\\nNo signiﬁcant differences were observed in overall survival\\nbetween CRC-DD and CRC-SD (P = .07; Fig 1D) nor\\nbetween CRC-DD and RAS/RAF wild-type CRC (P = .80;\\nFig 1D). The median CRC-DD survival was 63.5 months\\n(95% CI, 56.1 to not-reached), whereas the median CRC-\\nSD survival was 42.9 months (95% CI, 38.9 to 53.1).\\nMultivariate analysis showed that CRC-SD were linked\\nwith worse overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.74; 95% CI,\\n1.34 to 2.30; P , .001; Fig 1E).\\nGenetic Heterogeneity in CRC-DD Resolved by SCG\\nSCG performance tests showed a 96% mutation detection\\nrate and 92% genotype prediction accuracy (Data Sup-\\nplement). The presence of dual-clonal RAS/BRAF muta-\\ntions in nine CRC-DD cases suggested that these mutations\\nco-occur within the same cell. To conﬁrm this, we per-\\nformed SCG on 2,094 cells across four CRC-DD cases (P-\\n0021518, P-0061563, C-XPMDEU, and P-0008729) and\\nobtained genotypes on 1,170 cells with a median genotype\\nposterior probability of (P(g)) ≥0.99 (interquartile range\\n0.98-1.00 for mutations and interquartile range 0.62-1 for\\nframe shifts; Data Supplement).\\nSix\\nmutations\\nwere\\ndetected\\nby\\nMSK-IMPACT\\nfor\\nP-0021518: PTEN I135V, APC S1505Afs, APC I1008Yfs,\\nKRAS G12C, NRAS G13D, and TP53 C275Y (Fig 2). A total\\nof 480 cells were sorted from four tumor regions of\\nP-0021518 (Q1→4) and one normal control region (Q5), of\\nwhich 387 yielded genotypes for all mutations (83, 85, 71,\\n80, and 68 cells for Q1→5, respectively). The average\\nnumber of tumor cells across all regions was 74 6 5\\n(93.6% 6 6.6%). The 75 cells from non-neoplastic tissue\\nhad homozygous wild-type genotypes for all mutations. In\\nthe tumor sample, 21 cells were found with all wild-type\\ngenotypes from the tumor regions, and 298 cells harbored\\nat least one genotyped mutation (Fig 2A). We observed a\\nsame-cell co-occurrence of KRAS G13D and NRAS G12C\\nin 95% of tumor cells. These results are concordant with\\nFACETS results from MSK-IMPACT data, which predicted\\nthe NRAS and KRAS mutations to be clonal without AI (CCF\\n1.0 and 0.96, respectively, total copy number = 2). A subset\\nof 11 cells with SCG data was submitted for Sanger se-\\nquencing and conﬁrmed the mutations (Fig 2B). We rep-\\nlicated the Sanger sequence of NRAS G12C and KRAS\\nG13D in an independent set of 16 cells and conﬁrmed the\\nsame-cell mutation co-occurrence (Figs 2B and 2C).\\nTo determine if P-0021518 displayed spatial heterogeneity\\nin the proportion of tumor cells harboring both mutations,\\nwe sequenced several regions. Same-cell co-occurrence of\\nNRAS G12C and KRAS G13D mutations were detected in\\n95%, 93%, 96%, and 99% of sequenced tumor cells for\\nregions Q1 through Q4, respectively (Fig 2D).

The MSI status was conﬁrmed by mismatch\\nrepair immunohistochemistry for both samples, and the\\nclonal relationship was demonstrated by the presence of\\nseveral shared somatic mutations of MSK-IMPACT.

AI occurred in 26 of the 86 RAS/BRAF V600E\\nmutations of these tumors. At the gene level, AI was most\\nprevalent in KRAS, accounting for 21 of 65 instances,\\nfollowed by NRAS with ﬁve of 13 instances. AI was present\\nin clonal and subclonal in equal proportions of NRAS and\\nKRAS. No BRAF V600E mutations displayed AI. In the\\nCRC-DD, AI was signiﬁcantly enriched in cases where one\\ndriver was clonal and the second was subclonal (ie, clonal-\\nsubclonal): At least one MAPK driver mutation displayed AI\\nin one of nine cases of the clonal-clonal group, nine of 17\\ncases in the clonal-subclonal group, and none in the\\nsubclonal-subclonal group (P = .0006). KRAS mutations\\ndisplayed AI in two of 14 cases in the clonal-clonal group,\\n11 of 17 cases in the clonal-subclonal group, and none of\\n14 cases in the subclonal-subclonal group, conﬁrming an\\nenrichment of AI in at least one MAPK hotspot mutation in\\nCRC-DD with one clonal and one subclonal MAPK hotspot\\nmutation (P = .0074). Both CRC-DD with clonal KRAS and\\nclonal BRAF V600E were MSI-H without mutant AI.\\nFourteen patients showed double KRAS-KRAS pairings:\\nEach of the two mutations occurred on different reads,\\nmeaning the mutations either occurred in trans or in dif-\\nferent cells but not on the same allele (Data Supplement).\\nMolecular Features of CRC-DD Versus CRC-SD\\nRAS hotspot and BRAF V600E mutations were signiﬁcantly\\nmore likely to occur subclonally in CRC-DD than CRC-SD\\n(P = 8 × 10–9). Comparisons for the low-frequency muta-\\ntions are shown in the Data Supplement. Mutation prev-\\nalence in recurrently mutated CRC genes including\\nPIK3CA, APC, and TP53 was not signiﬁcantly different\\nbetween CRC-SD and CRC-DD (P . .05).\\nAI of the oncogenic mutant allele was signiﬁcantly less\\nprevalent in the CRC-DD (26 of 80 mutations) cohort in\\ncomparison with the CRC-SD (119 of 232 mutations) cohort\\n(32.5% v 51.3%, respectively; P = .0026). AI was more\\nfrequently seen in KRAS mutations in CRC-DD compared\\nwith CRC-SD (P = .038). Neither of the two BRAF p.V600E\\nmutations in the CRC-DD had AI while BRAF p.V600E\\nmutations in the CRC-SD sometimes demonstrated AI\\n(Data Supplement).\\nCRC-DD had lower genomic instability, or fraction of ge-\\nnome\\naltered\\n(FGA),\\nas\\ncompared\\nwith\\nCRC-SD\\n(P = 7.99 × 10–9). The differences persisted even when\\nrestricted to MSS tumors (P = 2.67 × 10–7). The average\\nFGA\\nfor\\nthe\\nCRC-DD\\nand\\nCRC-SD\\ncohorts\\nwas\\n0.325 6 0.224 and 0.511 6 0.244, respectively. The\\nsubclonal-subclonal group had the least amount of unstable\\ngenomes marked by lower FGA mean (0.163 6 0.119), and\\nthe clonal-subclonal group had the largest variability\\n(0.412 6 0.261; P = .0007). CRC-SD with subclonal RAS\\nhotspot/BRAF V600E mutations also had lower FGA mean\\n(0.347 6 0.251 v 0.505 6 0.239 in subclonal v clonal,\\nrespectively; P = .0019; Data Supplement).\\nMSI-H status was enriched in CRC-DD (P = .028; Data\\nSupplement). Twenty-seven percent of CRC-DD were MSI-\\nH, and all BRAF V600E mutants in the CRC-DD group were\\nMSI-H, compared with an MSI-H rate of 8.7% across the\\ncohort by Yaeger et al (P = .0004). No CRC-DD harbored\\nPOLE exonuclease domain hotspot mutations. Because\\ncytosine to thymine transition mutations are part of the\\nsignature of MSI-H/mismatch repair deﬁciency, we sur-\\nveyed our MSI-H CRC-DD oncogene driver mutations (Data\\nSupplement for methods). Of the 12 MSI-H CRC-DD, all\\nhad at least 1C.T or G.A (corresponding mutation on\\ncomplementary strand) driver mutation, with both drivers\\nconsisting of C.T or G.A mutations in seven of the 12\\nMSI-H CRC-DD. Of the 33 MSS CRC-DD, 16 had one driver\\nmutation with C.T or G.A mutation, 8 had C.T or G.A\\nmutations as both driver mutations, and nine had neither\\noncogenic MAPK driver mutation with C.T or G.A mu-\\ntation. These analyses show that the C.T/G.A transitions\\nwere enriched in oncogenic MAPK pathway mutations in\\nMSI-H CRC-DD (P = .043, one-tailed test), with MSI-H\\nchronologically preceding these mutations.\\nDual Drivers in Colorectal Cancer\\nJCO Precision Oncology\\n5\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC8906458', 'name': 'Colorectal Cancer (MSK, JCO Precis Oncol 2022)', 'description': 'Molecular characterization of 47 BRAF inhibitor-naive colorectal cancer patients with dual RAS hotspot/BRAF V600E mutations.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '35235413', 'citation': 'Gularte-Merida et al.

Indeed, we found that the majority (99%) of CRC\\nhad either a single-driver or no canonical-driver mutation.\\nYet, CRC-DD cases account for 1% of advanced, targeted\\ntherapy-naive CRC. Intratumoral heterogeneity may be\\npresent; both mutations are usually present across multiple\\ntumor sites; and mutant allelic imbalances which increase\\noncogenic mutant dose are less common in CRC-DD. We\\nﬁnd that concurrent BRAF V600E and RAS hotspot mu-\\ntations are extremely rare and are only seen in MSI-H CRC.\\nFour cases (9%) showed co-occurrence between a typical\\nKRAS mutation and an atypical KRAS V14I of cases, as has\\nalso been seen by Pietrantonio et al.18 This mutation likely\\nconfers higher MAPK activity than wild-type KRAS, as re-\\ncently proposed by Loree et al.19 Furthermore, we show that\\ndual MAPK pathway driver mutations co-occur within the\\nsame tumor cell at a relatively high frequency. Our ﬁndings\\ncontradict the classic belief that MAPK pathway driver\\nmutations such as RAS hotspot mutations and BRAF\\nV600E occur only in mutual exclusivity of each other.20\\nWhile the mechanism behind how this occurs remains\\nunknown, the biological reason for the existence of dual\\ndrivers might be related to the dosage of MAPK output and\\nthe increased ﬁtness it provides.\\nRecently, oncogene mutation AI that increases the mutant\\nMAPK pathway allele dose has been recognized as an\\nimportant event in cancer progression. CNA of wild-type\\nKRAS G12D is associated with higher grade pathology\\nand metabolic reprogramming in non–small-cell lung\\ncancer21,22 and in vitro sensitivity to MEK inhibition in colon\\ncancer cell lines.23 AI through loss of wild-type allele or copy\\nnumber gains is found in 55% of KRAS-mutant cancers.23\\nIncreasing KRAS-mutant dose in CRC is associated with\\nMAPK pathway dependence, and oncogene mutation AI\\nincreases tumor cell ﬁtness.12\\nWhile loss of the wild-type allele enhances the response to\\ntargeted therapy in melanoma,12 ampliﬁcation of the mu-\\ntant allele and KRAS and NRAS hotspot mutations are\\nmechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF V600E inhi-\\nbition in CRC.24 The present study included only patients\\nwho were naive to targeted therapy, and it is likely this 1.1%\\nof CRC patients would not beneﬁt from targeted therapy as\\nsuggested by the aforementioned studies. In addition, our\\nresults show that BRAF V600E mutations can co-exist with\\ntypical RAS mutations, although this type of tumor is ex-\\ntremely rare: Three in 4,561 (0.06%) of CRC and CCFs\\nrange from clonal to subclonal in CRC-DD. Moreover, re-\\nsistance to targeted therapies often develops within\\n6 months of treatment through the emergence of on-\\npathway MAPK alterations from EGFR, BRAF, HER2,\\nand TRK inhibition.2,8,25,26 These patient data suggest that a\\nsmall reservoir of dual-driver cells are selected under tar-\\ngeted therapy, and the importance of dual drivers may be a\\nbroader phenomenon with implications for targeted therapy\\nin CRC.\\nWe observed that oncogene driver mutation AI was sig-\\nniﬁcantly decreased in CRC-DD compared with CRC-SD\\nand that MSI-H status was enriched in CRC-DD: a unique\\nfeature of this disease subset.

To assess the\\ngenomic landscapes of neoplastic cysts of the pancreas, we de-\\ntermined the exomic sequences of DNA from the neoplastic epithe-\\nlium of eight surgically resected cysts of each of the major neoplastic\\ncyst types: serous cystadenomas (SCAs), intraductal papillary mucin-\\nous neoplasms (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), and solid\\npseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs). SPNs are low-grade malignancies,\\nand IPMNs and MCNs, but not SCAs, have the capacity to progress to\\ncancer. We found that SCAs, IPMNs, MCNs, and SPNs contained 10 ±\\n4.6, 27 ± 12, 16 ± 7.6, and 2.9 ± 2.1 somatic mutations per tumor,\\nrespectively. Among the mutations identiﬁed, E3 ubiquitin ligase\\ncomponents were of particular note. Four of the eight SCAs con-\\ntained mutations of the von Hippel–Lindau gene (VHL), a key compo-\\nnent of the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex that has previously been\\nassociated with renal cell carcinomas, SCAs, and other neoplasms. Six\\nof the eight IPMNs and three of the eight MCNs harbored mutations\\nof RNF43, a gene coding for a protein with intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase\\nactivity that has not previously been found to be genetically altered\\nin any human cancer. The preponderance of inactivating mutations in\\nRNF43 unequivocally establish it as a suppressor of both IPMNs and\\nMCNs. SPNs contained remarkably few genetic alterations but always\\ncontained mutations of CTNNB1, previously demonstrated to inhibit\\ndegradation of the encoded protein (β-catenin) by E3 ubiquitin\\nligases. These results highlight the essential role of ubiquitin ligases\\nin these neoplasms and have important implications for the diagnosis\\nand treatment of patients with cystic tumors.\\nA\\ns the result of the increasing use of abdominal imaging in\\nstandard medical practice, pancreatic cysts are being identiﬁed\\nwith increasing frequency. Management of these cysts is concomi-\\ntantly becoming a major clinical problem (1, 2). Cystic lesions occur\\nin more than 20% of patients examined at autopsy (3), in as many as\\n19.6% of patients evaluated by MRI (4–6), and in as many as 2.6%\\nof patients evaluated by computed tomography (7, 8). In the vast\\nmajority of cases, the cysts are identiﬁed as incidental ﬁndings in\\npatients undergoing imaging for symptoms unrelated to pancreatic\\npathology. However, once a cyst is identiﬁed, it poses a challenging\\nlife-long management problem (1, 2, 9–13). Some cyst types are\\nvirtually always benign, some are low-grade malignant, and others\\nare precursors to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas\\n(PDAs); PDAs are associated with a dismal prognosis (14–17). The\\ndistinction among cyst types is therefore critical for the effective\\nmanagement of patients with pancreatic cysts. Unfortunately, it is\\noften difﬁcult to determine the type of cyst from conventional\\nclinical, radiographic, or cytologic ﬁndings (1, 2, 9–17).\\nApproximately 40% of cysts are nonneoplastic “pseudocysts”\\nthat develop as a complication of alcoholic, biliary, or traumatic\\nacute pancreatitis (14–17). They are managed medically or by\\nsurgical drainage without resection. The neoplastic cysts (60% of\\nthe total cysts) are predominantly of four types: intraductal papil-\\nlary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms\\n(MCNs), serous cystadenomas (SCAs), and solid pseudopapillary\\nneoplasms (SPNs) (18). SCAs, IPMNs, and MCNs are benign (i.e.,\\nnoninvasive), but IPMNs and MCNs have the potential to progress\\nto PDAs (i.e., become invasive lesions) if not surgically excised (17).\\nBased on the age of patients undergoing surgical resection, some\\nreports have suggested that there is a 5-y lag time from diagnosis of\\na large noninvasive IPMN (average age of 63.2 y) to diagnosis of an\\ninvasive cancer stemming from the IPMN (average age of 68.1 y).\\nThis provides a broad time window for curative resection if pre-\\nmalignant cysts are accurately identiﬁed (19). SPNs are regarded as\\nlow-grade malignant, but they can be cured by surgery if they are\\ndetected and removed before their widespread metastasis (20).\\nIPMNs are the most common type of neoplastic cyst, accounting\\nfor ∼25–35% of the total cysts, whereas SCAs, MCNs, and SPNs\\naccount for ∼20%, ∼10%, and ∼5% of pancreatic cysts, re-\\nspectively. SCAs (Fig. 1A) are lined by cuboidal glycogen-rich ep-\\nithelium with centrally placed round nuclei without atypia (17).\\nThe epithelium of SCAs is associated with a rich capillary network\\n(21). IPMNs (Fig. 1B) arise within the normal ductal system and\\nare lined by columnar mucin-producing cells that often form large\\npapillary projections into ductal lumina (17). MCNs (Fig. 1C) are\\nalso lined by columnar mucin-producing cells, but in contrast to\\nIPMNs, the neoplastic epithelium is associated with a character-\\nistic ovarian-type stroma and the cysts do not communicate with\\nthe ductal system (17). MCNs nearly always occur in the body or tail\\nof the pancreas in women, whereas IPMNs and SCAs can occur\\nin any part of the pancreas and in both sexes. SPNs (Fig. 1 E and\\nF) are technically solid tumors, but the vast majority of them\\nundergo cystic degeneration that clinically and radiographically\\nAuthor contributions: J.W., A.M., L.A.D., K.W.K., N.P., R.H.H., and B.V. designed research;\\nJ.W., Y.J., R.F.d.W., N.P., and B.V. performed research; M.D.M., A.M., L.D.W., J.R.E., M.G.G.,\\nC.L.W., M.I.C., R.D.S., B.H.E., M.A.C., V.A., D.S.K., G.J.A.O., A.P.K., L.K., P.J.A., C.M.S.,\\nY.N., L.A.D., and R.H.H. contributed new reagents/analytic tools; J.W., Y.J., H.C., R.K.,\\nK.W.K., N.P., R.H.H., and B.V. analyzed data; and K.W.K., R.H.H., and B.V. wrote the paper.\\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\\n1J.W., Y.J., and M.D.M. contributed equally to this work.\\n2To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Like\\nMCNs, they generally occur in women and do not communicate\\nwith the ductal system. Histologically, SPNs consist of uniform\\npoorly cohesive cells supported by delicate small blood vessels. The\\nneoplastic cells of SPNs do not have a normal counterpart in the\\nnormal pancreas.\\nTo date, a deﬁnitive diagnosis of neoplastic cyst type can usually\\nonly be obtained following histopathological examination of sur-\\ngically obtained specimens. The decision to resect pancreatic cysts\\nsurgically is based on the presumed type of cyst along with clinical\\nparameters. Resection is performed on all cysts that are presumed\\nto be SPNs. In contrast, cysts diagnosed as SCAs only require re-\\nsection if they cause symptoms. Finally, patients with presumptive\\nMCNs or IPMNs undergo surgery if they meet certain criteria, such\\nas rapid growth or the presence of a mural nodule (1, 2, 9–13). The\\npreoperative diagnosis of surgically excised cysts has been shown to\\nbe erroneous in one-third of cases and errors can lead to un-\\nnecessary surgical procedures (22). For example, there is no need to\\nexcise small asymptomatic SCAs, because they have essentially no\\nmalignant potential (17). However, SCAs are sometimes suspected\\nto be IPMNs and therefore surgically excised (1, 2, 22). Major\\nsurgical procedures are often required for removal of these cystic\\nlesions; thus, more accurate presurgical diagnosis has the potential\\nto reduce the cost, morbidity, and occasional mortality associated\\nwith unnecessary surgery.\\nCyst ﬂuids can easily and safely be obtained from patients with\\npancreatic cysts by endoscopic aspiration (23–28). These ﬂuids are\\noften acellular, and therefore not typically useful for cytological\\ndiagnosis. However, such ﬂuids can be analyzed for the presence of\\nbiochemical abnormalities, including those of DNA, and have the\\npotential to inform diagnosis and improve the management of\\npatients with these lesions (23–28). To set the stage for future mo-\\nlecular genetics-based diagnostic assays, we have here determined\\nthe sequences of the exomes, including all annotated coding genes,\\nof representative cases of all four types of neoplastic cysts.\\n"), Document(page_content='Results\\nExperimental Design. Neoplastic cysts are composed of a mixture of\\nneoplastic epithelial cells and nonneoplastic cells [stromal, vas-\\ncular, and inﬂammatory (17)] (Fig. 1). To maximize our ability to\\ndetect mutations, we carefully microdissected the neoplastic epi-\\nthelial cells from the nonneoplastic cells. This was most difﬁcult in\\nthe MCNs because of the cellular ovarian-type stroma present in\\nthese lesions (Fig. 1 C and D). Following microdissection, the\\nneoplastic cell content of each of the cyst samples analyzed in this\\nstudy was at least 33%.\\nDNA from 32 microdissected cysts, 8 of each of the four types, as\\nwell as matched DNA from normal tissues of the same patients was\\nused in this study. The clinical and histopathological characteristics\\nof the patients and their cystic lesions are detailed in Dataset S1.\\nThe DNA was ligated to adapters and ampliﬁed using standard\\nIllumina protocols. The ampliﬁed DNA was then captured with a\\n50-Mb SureSelect Paired-End Target Enrichment System (Agi-\\nlent). The captured DNA includes more than 20,000 coding genes\\n(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/gencode/) plus all miRNAs in miRBase,\\nv. 13 (http://www.mirbase.org). Sequencing was performed to rel-\\natively high depth on an Illumina GAII or HiSeq instrument [av-\\nerage unique coverage of 120-fold ± 40 per base pair in the 64\\nlibraries (32 from cyst DNA and 32 from matched normal DNA),\\nDataset S2].

Using SNPs in the sequences captured by the\\nSureSelect Paired-End Target Enrichment System, we were able to\\nidentify 15,190 ± 428 heterozygous variants in the matched normal\\nDNA samples of the eight patients with SCAs. Loss of heterozy-\\ngosity (LOH) of at least one chromosomal region was identiﬁed in\\neach of the eight SCAs studied (Fig. 2 and Dataset S3). The max-\\nimum degree of LOH (70% ± 13%) conﬁrmed the high fraction of\\nneoplastic cell content achieved on microdissection. The only re-\\ngion that was lost in the majority of SCAs was on chromosome 3p\\n(Fig. 2 and example in Fig. 3A). Seven of the eight SCAs lost chro-\\nmosome 3p alleles, with the losses demarcated by bases 9,934,713–\\n12,850,443. To determine whether this LOH was associated with\\nreduplication of the remaining allele, we compared the copy num-\\nber of all sequences lying within the regions of LOH with those of\\nall other chromosomal regions in the same cysts. This was accom-\\nplished by comparing normalized tag counts through digital kar-\\nyotyping (29), as explained in Materials and Methods.

Three of these four (SCA 23,\\nSCA 38, and SCA 40) showed evidence of LOH of the VHL\\nchromosomal region (Dataset S3). Interestingly, the four tumors\\nwithout detectable mutations of VHL (SCA 14, SCA 27, SCA 29,\\nand SCA 37) had lost one allele of chromosome 3p within or ad-\\njacent to VHL (Fig. 2 and Dataset S3). We speculate that in these\\nfour cases, the VHL gene was inactivated by genetic alterations,\\nsuch as deletions or translocations not detectable by sequencing, or\\nby epigenetic mechanisms such as those responsible for VHL si-\\nlencing in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (38).\\nSCAs have been identiﬁed in more than 15% of patients with\\nVHL syndrome, a disease that predisposes to RCCs and other tumor\\ntypes (39, 40). Of note, SCAs share several histomorphological\\ncharacteristics with RCCs, including excessive glycogen production\\nand a distinctive recruitment of vasculature (angiogenesis). All four\\nmutations in VHL identiﬁed in SCAs were identical to ones pre-\\nviously identiﬁed in RCCs (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/\\ncosmic/); three of the four were identical to ones previously de-\\nscribed in the germline of patients with VHL syndrome, and the\\nfourth (W117L) was at the same amino acid position found to be\\nmutated in the germline of patients with VHL syndrome. This pro-\\nvides conclusive evidence of the inactivating nature of these muta-\\ntions in human cells. In each of these four cases, we additionally\\nconﬁrmed that the VHL mutations in the cysts were somatic using\\nindependent ligation-based assays (Fig. 4 A and B).\\nTo our knowledge, no mutations of VHL, or any other gene,\\nhave been identiﬁed in the ﬂuids obtained from SCA cysts.\\nDemonstration of such mutations in samples obtained by ﬁne\\nneedle aspiration could be useful from a diagnostic standpoint,\\nas discussed above.

This type of\\nmutational pattern, with an overrepresentation of inactivating\\nmutations, is characteristic of tumor suppressor genes and is similar\\nto that observed for RNF43 in IPMNs (Table 1). One of the MCNs\\nwith a truncating mutation was a low-grade MCN (MCN 166),\\nwhereas the other two tumors with RNF43 mutations were high-\\ngrade MCNs.\\nIn addition to these RNF43 mutations, KRAS mutations were\\nfound in six MCNs and TP53 mutations were found in two.

The most notable ﬁnding about SPNs was the\\npaucity of genetic alterations identiﬁed. Only one of the eight\\ntumors studied exhibited any LOH whatsoever (Figs. 2 and 3 and\\nDataset S3). The absence of LOH was not attributable to con-\\ntamination of the microdissected samples with nonneoplastic\\ncells; this possibility could be excluded both by histopathological\\nanalysis and by the high fraction of CTNNB1 mutant alleles, as\\ndiscussed below (39–59%, Dataset S4).\\nAs with LOH, the number of point mutations was also very low\\n(2.9 ± 1.8 mutations per tumor). This number is lower than any of\\nthe other cyst types (P < 0.001) and, indeed, is less than any tumor\\ntype yet evaluated by genome-wide sequencing (49, 50), including\\npediatric tumors (51). Five of the eight tumors contained only one\\nor two somatic mutations (Dataset S4). Nevertheless, every tumor\\nhad a missense mutation of CTNNB1, and all these mutations were\\nat codon 32, 33, 34, or 37. This region of the encoded protein\\n(β-catenin) is critical for regulation of the protein (52–54). When\\nphosphorylated at serine or threonine residues lying between\\ncodons 32 and 37, β-catenin is degraded by E3 ubiquitin ligases.\\nMutations within this region inhibit phosphorylation and the con-\\nsequent degradation of the protein (55, 56). Previous studies have\\nshown that CTNNB1 is nearly always mutated in SPNs (57, 58). Our\\nstudy shows that the CTNNB1 mutations are the only mutations\\nthat are evident in these tumors in many cases, even when all coding\\ngenes are assessed by sequencing. An evaluation of these tumors for\\ntranslocations or epigenetic events may lead to the identiﬁcation of\\nadditional alterations. If not, this tumor type would represent an\\nexception to the widely held view that several sequential mutations\\nare required for the formation of solid tumors in adults (59).\\n'), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nThe results described above have implications for both basic and\\napplied research. It is fascinating that all four types of cysts are\\nassociated with defects in genes that are either components of\\nubiquitin ligase complexes (SCAs, IPMNs, and MCNs) or render\\nthem resistant to degradation by such complexes (SPNs). RNF43,\\ngenetically inactivated in both types of mucinous cysts (IPMNs and\\nMCNs), has intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (46). There has\\nbeen relatively little research on this gene’s product, although it has\\nbeen shown to be present in a complex that regulates p53-mediated\\napoptosis (60). Based on these past studies, it is likely that the tu-\\nmor suppressor effects of the WT RNF43 gene product are a result\\nof its ubiquitin ligase activity. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, it will be\\nimportant to determine the proteins that RNF43 ubiquinates\\nin vivo as well as to demonstrate that such ubiquitination is essential\\nfor its tumor-suppressive role.\\nIn contrast, VHL has been the subject of intense research since\\nits identiﬁcation as the gene responsible for VHL syndrome (61).\\nThe most well-studied function of VHL involves its role in\\nangiogenesis (62, 63). When cells are well-oxygenated, prolyl\\nhydroxylation of hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIFα)\\nproteins leads to their binding to VHL. VHL then recruits an\\nubiquitin ligase complex that leads to the ubiquitination and\\nsubsequent degradation of HIFα. When VHL is inactivated,\\nHIFα proteins are stabilized, resulting in the expression of nu-\\nmerous genes that stimulate angiogenesis even when cells\\nare well-oxygenated.\\nThere are at least two ways in which VHL mutations might\\nstimulate SCA formation. First, it has been noted that there is\\na rich capillary network within SCAs, presumably a result of the\\nabnormal activation of HIFα. This network could disturb local\\nhemodynamics, facilitating the production of cyst ﬂuid, and the\\nincreased local concentration of growth factors could stimulate\\nepithelial cell proliferation (21). A second possibility involves the\\nstabilization of microtubules, which is a well-documented but\\nless extensively studied function of the VHL protein (64, 65). In\\nthe absence of VHL, primary cilia are absent or defective (66). In\\nview of abundant evidence linking certain types of cysts to\\ndefects in primary cilia, it has been suggested that the microtu-\\nbule stabilization function of VHL is key to its role in suppressing\\ncysts (66). Several mouse models in which the VHL gene has\\nbeen inactivated develop various cysts (although not SCAs) (67–\\n70), suggesting fertile avenues for future research on this topic.\\nOur results also have potentially important diagnostic implica-\\ntions. As mentioned previously in this report, the distinction among\\nvarious types of cysts before surgical intervention is critically im-\\nportant for patient management (1, 2, 9–17). Cyst ﬂuid can be readily\\nobtained from such patients and subjected to analytical assays (22,\\n23, 26, 27, 71–73). Our results show that the analysis of only ﬁve\\ngenes (VHL, RNF43, CTNNB1, GNAS, and KRAS) can usually\\ndistinguish among cyst types (Table 1): All eight SCAs had intragenic\\nmutations of VHL or LOH in or adjacent to VHL and did not contain\\nmutations of the other four genes; all eight IPMNs had alterations of\\nRNF43, GNAS, or KRAS and never had VHL or CTNNB1 muta-\\ntions; MCNs always harbored KRAS or RNF43 mutations but never\\ncontained GNAS, CTNNB1, or VHL mutations; and SPNs always\\ncontained CTNNB1 mutations and never contained mutations of the\\nother four genes. When combined with clinical and radiological data,\\nthe molecular genetic analysis of cyst ﬂuid could thereby lead to\\nmore accurate diagnosis. For IPMNs and MCNs, it will be important\\nto determine whether the number and type of genetic alterations in\\nGNAS, RNF43, and other genes can be used to help gauge the risk\\nfor progression to invasive cancers. The examination of a large\\nnumber of cyst ﬂuid samples from patients with all four cyst types will\\nbe required to determine the added value of molecular genetic\\nanalyses for these and other diagnostic purposes.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nPatients and Specimens. The present study was approved by the Institutional\\nReview Boards of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Memorial Sloan–\\nKettering Cancer Center, Wayne State University, Emory University, and the\\nUniversity of Indiana. DNA was puriﬁed and libraries were prepared as\\ndescribed (74). Captured DNA libraries were sequenced with the Illumina\\nGAIIx/HiSeq Genome Analyzer, using one lane per sample, yielding 150 (2 ×\\n75) base pairs from the ﬁnal library fragments. Sequencing reads were\\nanalyzed and aligned to human genome hg18 with the Eland algorithm in\\nCASAVA 1.7 software (Illumina). Mutations were conﬁrmed as described in\\nref. 41 using the primers listed in Dataset S6. Further details are provided in\\nSI Materials and Methods.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank J. Schaeffer, J.

Lander, December 29, 2011 (sent for review November 22, 2011)\\nTo gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell\\nlymphoma (DLBCL), we performed massively parallel whole-exome\\nsequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with DLBCL\\nand matched normal tissue. We identiﬁed recurrent mutations in\\ngenes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL,\\nincluding MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identiﬁed\\nsomatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has\\nnot been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2,\\nBTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show\\nthat BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH\\nrearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally\\noccurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily\\nsynonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine de-\\naminase–mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by compre-\\nhensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs.\\nThose nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be\\nfound outside of the functionally important BH domains of the\\nprotein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2\\nloss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm\\ndesigned to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent\\nmutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers\\nof DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an un-\\nbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn\\nmay point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.\\nnext-generation sequencing | human genetics | activation-induced\\ndeaminase\\nD\\niffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive non-\\nHodgkin lymphoma that affects 30,000 new patients in the\\nUnited States every year (1, 2). The standard of care for the\\ntreatment of most cases of DLBCL is the R-CHOP regimen (rit-\\nuximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and predni-\\nsone) consisting of multiagent chemotherapy plus a therapeutic\\nantibody directed against CD20, a marker of B lymphocytes. The\\n3-year event-free survival rate is approximately 60%, with the\\nmajority of the remaining 40% dying of their disease (3). To date,\\ntreatment strategies to improve outcome have largely included\\nincreased doses of standard agents in the context of autologous\\nstem cell transplantation (4). Therefore, there is a great medical\\nneed to deﬁne the genetic abnormalities that are associated with\\nDLBCL to deﬁne novel targets for therapy.\\nGerminal centers (GCs) in lymphoid tissues are sites of clonal\\nexpansion and editing of the Ig receptor in B lymphocytes, and\\nthis GC reaction is a physiological component of the humoral im-\\nmune response. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is part of the GC\\nreaction, and its dysregulation contributes to the accumulation of\\nsomatic mutations in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes in\\nB lymphocytes.\\nTraditionally, DLBCL has been classiﬁed by the morphology\\nand immunophenotype of the malignant B-cells but more re-\\ncently, molecular classiﬁcations have been reported. Speciﬁcally,\\ngene expression-based classiﬁcation of DLBCL has been pro-\\nposed (5, 6), and the prognostic relevance for this has been\\ndemonstrated (7). It has been suggested that distinct signal\\ntransduction pathways are affected in the subtypes that are de-\\nﬁned in this way, and that certain genetic defects preferentially\\noccur in speciﬁc subtypes deﬁned by the presumed cell of origin\\nof the tumors (8–12).\\nHowever, comprehensive understanding of the genomic land-\\nscape of DLBCL is lacking. In particular, a key question is which\\nmutations and pathways drive DLBCL pathogenesis. We report\\nhere the unbiased sequencing of all protein-coding exons in 55\\nDLBCL patients, comparing each to its patient-matched normal\\ncontrol. We uncover mutations that provide insights into mech-\\nanisms of lymphomagenesis.\\n"), Document(page_content="Results\\nWhole-Exome Sequencing Reveals Recurrent Mutations in DLBCL.

To better\\nestimate the signiﬁcance of observed mutations, MutSig takes into\\naccount (i) the sample-speciﬁc mutation rate, (ii) the ratio of\\nnonsynonymous to synonymous mutations in a given gene, and\\n(iii) the median expression level of each gene in DLBCL [based\\non gene expression proﬁling datasets (7)]. This approach revealed\\n58 statistically signiﬁcant genes with a false discovery rate cutoff\\nof 0.1 (q1 ≤0.1; Fig. 1B, Table 1, and Tables S1 and S2). We\\nindependently validated selected mutations by targeted rese-\\nquencing in a subset of patients and obtained 97.9% validation\\nrate (Table S5).\\nAmong the signiﬁcantly mutated genes were those for which a\\nfunctional role in the pathogenesis of DLBCL has accumulated\\nover many years. These include CD79B, TP53, CARD11, MYD88,\\nand EZH2 (8–11). In addition, we discovered mutations in genes\\nfor which a pathogenic role in DLBCL has been suggested re-\\ncently (17, 18). These include MLL2, TNFRSF14, BTG1, MEF2B,\\nand GNA13, which are discussed in greater detail later.\\nWe discovered mutations in genes not previously recognized\\nas drivers of cancer. For example, we found β-actin (ACTB)\\nmutations in ﬁve patients (Fig. 2). Actins are highly conserved\\nproteins of the cytoskeleton and are involved in B lymphocyte\\nactivation (19). By using the xvar algorithm (based on evolu-\\ntionary conservation and the nature of the observed amino acid\\nchange), the predicted functional consequence of the ACTB\\nmutations observed in DLBCL is high. We also note a pre-\\nponderance of ACTB mutations toward the amino terminus\\nof the protein, but the functional signiﬁcance of this remains\\nunknown.\\nAnother unexpectedly recurrently mutated gene is P2RY8,\\nencoding a G protein-coupled purinergic receptor whose normal\\nfunction has not been extensively characterized (20). P2RY8 is\\nmost notable for its involvement in a chromosomal translocation\\nwith CRLF2 in 7% of patients with B-progenitor acute lympho-\\nblastic leukemia (ALL) and 53% of individuals with ALL and\\nDown syndrome (21). The presumed mechanism of action of such\\nP2RY8/CRLF2 fusions is activation of CRLF2 by its coming under\\nthe control of the P2RY8 promoter, which is highly active in B\\nlymphoid cells (21). However, we note that P2RY8 has itself been\\nreported to function as an oncogene in experimental models (22).\\nIn DLBCL, we identiﬁed six patients with coding mutations in\\nP2RY8, two of whom harbored two mutations (Fig. 2). In three\\npatients, the observed allelic fraction of these mutations is greater\\nthan 0.5, suggestive of deletion of the WT allele or ampliﬁcation\\nof the mutant allele. The functional consequence of P2RY8\\nmutation in DLBCL remains to be determined.\\nWe also observed very common mutations in the gene PCLO\\n(Piccolo), encoding a protein that functions as part of the pre-\\nsynaptic cytoskeletal matrix thought to be involved in regulating\\nneurotransmitter release (23). A role for PCLO in calcium\\nsensing has also been suggested (24), but a role in cancer has not\\nbeen reported. We found a total of 23 nonsynonymous mutations\\nin 17 patients (35%; Fig. S2), but the observed ratio of non-\\nsynonymous to synonymous mutations (23:3) is consistent with\\nthat expected by chance, given that most of the observed muta-\\ntions (12 of 23) are transversion mutations, which favor non-\\nsynonymous outcomes by a ratio of nearly 5:1. It is thus possible\\nthat, for unknown reasons, the local rate of mutation at the\\nFig. 1.\\nSigniﬁcantly mutated genes in 49 patients with DLBCL.

BTG1\\nbelongs to the BTG/Tob family of proteins that regulate cell cycle\\nprogression in a variety of cells. BTG1 is thought to confer DNA\\nbinding of sequence-speciﬁc transcription factors (31). Whether\\nmutations in BTG1 result in aberrations in chromatin structure\\n(as with MLL-family mutations) as opposed to nonhistone targets\\nremains to be determined. Interestingly, we observed several\\npatients with more than one mutation in BTG1, including two\\npatients with three mutations and one patient with four muta-\\ntions. In the latter patient, two sets of adjacent mutations (L37L\\nplus L31F and P3R plus M1I) were never found in the same se-\\nquencing read, suggesting that they occurred on different alleles,\\ni.e., in trans. We note that two patients had the identical silent\\nmutation at codon 31, suggesting that this mutation, although\\nit did not affect protein coding sequence, may alter codon use\\nor mRNA stability. Overall, the nature of BTG1 mutations does\\nnot clearly point toward a gain-of-function or loss-of-function\\nmechanism, although the biallelic involvement seen in some\\npatients tends to favor loss of function (Fig. 2).\\nMEF2B mutations were observed in 18% of patients with\\nDLBCL, similar to data reported recently (17, 18), predominantly\\nin the MADS box or MEF2 domains. MEF2B belongs to a family\\nof calcium-regulated transcription factors that recruit histone-\\nmodifying enzymes. Further supporting an oncogenic role for\\nMEF2 proteins, MEF2C has been identiﬁed as a T-cell acute\\nlymphoblastic leukemia oncogene that is activated by chromo-\\nsomal rearrangement (32).\\nNegative Selection Against Deleterious BCL2 Mutations. A hallmark\\nof cancer genes (i.e., genes that harbor “driver” mutations, which\\ncontribute to the formation and progression of cancer) is the\\npreponderance of nonsynonymous mutations compared with\\nsynonymous mutations (typically with an expected ratio of ∼2.8:1).\\nCuriously, we observed a striking opposite effect in the BCL2\\ngene—a known driver in some DLBCLs. We observed a very high\\nmutation rate in BCL2, but with a depletion of nonsynonymous\\nmutations, with 18 nonsynonymous mutations and 28 synonymous\\nmutations, for a ratio of 0.64, far below that expected by chance\\n(P = 8.8 × 10−6; Fig. 3). We hypothesized that this phenomenon\\nmight be caused by two processes: ﬁrst, a locally high mutation rate\\nat the BCL2 locus occurring via SHM, and second, negative se-\\nlection against functionally deleterious mutations.\\nWe ﬁrst explored the possibility that the high rate of BCL2\\nmutations observed in our patients might be related to SHM. This\\nphysiologic process in B lymphocytes has been best studied at Ig\\ngene loci, where it facilitates the development of antibody di-\\nversity (33), but other genes have been shown to be subject to\\naberrant SHM (including the PIM1 gene, in which we also ob-\\nserved hypermutation with 30 mutations in 16 patients; Fig. S2)\\n(34). Chromosomal translocations of the BCL2 gene into the Ig\\nheavy chain (IgH) locus occur in approximately 20% of DLBCL\\ntumors, and the resulting BCL2 overexpression provides an\\nantiapoptotic signal to the lymphoma cells (35). We hypothesized\\nthat BCL2 hypermutation in our patients might be explained by\\nthe BCL2 gene adopting the IgH locus’s normal process of SHM\\nas a result of the translocation (36). If this hypothesis were cor-\\nrect, those tumors with elevated BCL2 mutation rates would be\\nexpected to also harbor BCL2/IgH translocations. We tested for\\nBCL2/IgH translocation in 26 patients with DLBCL (13 with\\nBCL2 mutation and 13 others selected randomly). As predicted,\\nthe vast majority of patients with BCL2 hypermutation (10 of 13,\\n77%) had BCL2/IgH translocation, whereas only one of 13\\npatients (8%) lacking BCL2 mutation had the translocation (P =\\n0.0005, one-sided Fisher exact test; Fig. S3). To determine\\nwhether BCL2 or other genes may be targets of SHM, which is\\nmediated by AID, we asked whether mutations occur preferen-\\ntially in the context of WRCY motifs, which are known target\\nsequences of AID. This analysis indeed revealed that BCL2, as\\nwell as other genes, including PIM1, have signiﬁcant enrichment\\nof mutations in WRCY motifs (Table S3).\\nAlthough these results likely explain the hypermutation at the\\nBCL2 locus, they do not explain the preponderance of synony-\\nmous mutations observed in these patients. We hypothesized\\nthat they represent a vestige of negative selection against dele-\\nterious mutations in BCL2, on which the tumor cells are de-\\npendent for survival. If this hypothesis were correct, we would\\nexpect that any nonsynonymous mutations would be conﬁned to\\nfunctionally nonessential domains of the protein, whereas the\\nsynonymous mutations would not. To address this, we focused on\\nthe BCL2 BH domains that mediate interactions with proa-\\npoptotic proteins (37). We observed 18 nonsynonymous muta-\\ntions, but only three of these fell within BH domains, whereas\\n15 of 28 synonymous mutations fell within BH domains (Fig. 3).\\nWe used permutations to determine the probability of non-\\nsynonymous mutations being located within versus outside BH\\ndomains, corrected for domain size. To increase the power of\\nthis analysis, we included the BCL2 mutations observed in the\\npresent study and those recently reported (17). This analysis\\nindicated a signiﬁcant enrichment of nonsynonymous mutations\\nfalling outside of BH domains (P = 0.041). These results argue\\nthat the nonsynonymous mutations preserve BCL2 function by\\navoiding critical BH domains. On the contrary, we found the\\nsynonymous mutations to be preferentially located within BH\\ndomains (P = 0.02). This can be explained by nonuniform dis-\\ntribution of these mutations along the gene (P = 0.045) with\\npreferential clustering at the 5′ end. This is consistent with\\nprevious demonstrations of aberrant SHM preferentially occur-\\nring closer to the 5′ end (34).\\nOur results are most consistent with purifying selection (i.e.,\\nnegative selection) against mutations that inhibit or decrease\\nBCL2 function.

Whether there is\\na functional consequence of these synonymous mutations, for\\nexample by affecting mRNA stability, remains to be determined.\\nIdentifying Functionally Relevant but Rare Mutations. The preceding\\nsections focused on the identiﬁcation of cancer genes based on\\ntheir mutation frequency across the whole genome. However,\\nadditional genes may harbor functionally important mutations\\nthat fall short of statistical signiﬁcance (in the standard mutation\\nfrequency test) given the modest size of our dataset. Some of\\nthese genes are recognizable based on their known importance\\nin the pathogenesis of other malignancies. For example, we ob-\\nserved two mutations in KRAS (G13D), four mutations in\\nNOTCH1, and two mutations in BRAF, often involving speciﬁc\\namino acids documented to be sites of recurrent mutation in the\\nCatalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database.\\nIt therefore seems likely that these mutations similarly play\\na causal role in DLBCL, albeit at a low frequency. To perform\\nthis search in a rigorous manner, we also tested each gene\\nwhether it has an increased mutation rate only in sites previously\\nreported in the COSMIC database. Table S4 shows a list of the\\nmost signiﬁcant genes identiﬁed by this test.\\nWe also sought to prioritize rare mutations based on the\\nclustering of mutations within particular regions of the coding\\nsequence. Mutations occurring by chance (i.e., passenger muta-\\ntions) would be expected to be scattered randomly across the\\nprotein, whereas functionally consequential mutations may clus-\\nter within critical domains. First, we assumed that mutations have\\na higher likelihood of functional impact if they are found at the\\nsame site or in close proximity to each other. For example, highly\\nclustered mutations are observed in MYD88, CARD11, CD79B,\\nand EZH2 (Fig. S4). Second, we assumed that mutated genes are\\nmore likely to be functionally relevant if the affected amino acid\\nresidue is more conserved across species. Our algorithm thus\\nreturns a list of mutated genes that is rank-ordered by a composite\\nscore reﬂecting sequence conservation and clustering of mutation\\nsites (Table 1). This analysis prioritized genes known to be mu-\\ntated in DLBCL and to play a role in its pathogenesis and also\\nnovel genes that would not otherwise be considered as likely\\ndrivers. For example, the tyrosine kinase SYK was identiﬁed as\\na likely driver based on these criteria, and it has recently been\\ndemonstrated that SYK inhibitors have signiﬁcant clinical activity\\nin non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including DLBCL (38, 39). Similarly,\\nthe serine/threonine kinase SGK1 was identiﬁed by this analysis\\ndespite its not reaching statistical signiﬁcance based on frequency\\nalone (q1 > 0.1), but a recent study conﬁrms the recurrent nature\\nof SGK1 mutation in DLBCL (17).\\n"), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nWe performed whole-exome sequencing on tumor samples and\\nmatched normal samples from 55 patients with DLBCL to\\nidentify the spectrum of mutations associated with the disease.\\nThis analysis provides a rich description of the DLBCL genome\\nand forms the basis for future discovery and therapeutic target\\nidentiﬁcation. In this single study, we rediscovered the genes\\npreviously discovered to be important drivers of DLBCL, and\\nidentiﬁed candidates deserving of functional follow-up.\\nNear the completion of our study, two groups reported their\\nanalysis of the DLBCL genome (17, 18). Remarkably, the re-\\ncurrently mutated genes identiﬁed in these studies are highly\\noverlapping [of our 58 signiﬁcantly mutated genes, 20 were also\\nreported as frequently mutated by Morin et al. (17), and 14 were\\nreported by Pasqualucci et al. (18)]. Such overlap provides strong\\nevidence that the mutations identiﬁed by our signiﬁcance\\nthresholds are indeed recurrent in DLBCL. The fact that these\\nstudies identiﬁed largely the same genes at similar frequency\\nsuggests that these are the most common targets of somatic\\nmutation in DLBCL. Although our results and interpretation are\\nlargely concordant with those recently published, we differ in our\\ninterpretation of the frequent mutations seen in the BCL2 gene.\\nWhereas Morin et al. (17) suggest that these are likely indicative\\nof positive selection for nonsynonymous variants, we suggest the\\nmutations are in fact passenger mutations and observe a de-\\npletion of damaging mutations in BCL2. Thus, whereas BCL2/\\nIgH translocation is likely indeed a driver of DLBCL, it also\\nincreases the overall mutation rate in BCL2 (via AID), and we\\nbelieve that the resulting point mutations are likely non-\\ncontributory to the pathogenesis of the disease. However, it is\\ninteresting to speculate that the striking recurrence of silent\\nmutations at two distinct residues may indicate a selective ad-\\nvantage that is conferred by silent mutations.\\nMore generally, a unique feature of B-cell malignancies is the\\nrole of SHM in increasing mutation frequency. Under normal\\nconditions, such SHM promotes afﬁnity maturation of antibodies,\\nbut the enzymes that mediate this effect, such as AID, may also\\nerroneously cause somatic mutations and structural abnormalities\\nin oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. High mutation rates\\nobserved at particular loci in the genome may therefore indicate\\nthe presence of dysfunctional SHM, rather than indicating posi-\\ntive selective growth advantage conferred by such mutations. Our\\nanalyses suggest that BCL2, as well as PIM1 and other genes, are\\nsubject to enrichment of mutations in WRCY hotspots, and\\ntherefore likely to represent AID targets. Although, in the case of\\nBCL2, SHM can be explained as a result of translocation to the\\nIgH locus (40), this is less clear for other genes. Whole-genome\\nsequencing approaches may reveal whether hypermutation and\\nchromosome translocation events are related more generally. A\\ncomplete elucidation of those frequently mutated genes that are\\ncontributory to the malignant phenotype, versus those that are\\nsimply frequent passenger mutations caused by local SHM will\\nrequire future studies.\\nOur list of signiﬁcantly mutated genes is based on the frequency\\nof the occurrence of mutations, corrected for the size of the gene\\nand its expression level, the sample-speciﬁc mutation rate, and\\nthe ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations. However,\\nsome mutations may be functionally important despite not\\nmeeting statistical signiﬁcance based on these criteria alone. As\\nan additional tool to discover these mutations, we analyzed the\\nclustering of mutations in hotspots of individual genes, evolu-\\ntionary conservation, and overlap with mutated genes reported in\\nBCL2\\nFig. 3.\\nSelection for functionally inconsequential muta-\\ntions in BCL2 and sites of somatic mutations in BCL2.\\nNonsynonymous mutations in BCL2 are preferentially lo-\\ncated outside of BH-domains.\\nLohr et al.\\nPNAS\\n|\\nMarch 6, 2012\\n|\\nvol. 109\\n|\\nno. 10\\n|\\n3883\\nGENETICS\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3309757', 'name': 'Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (Broad, PNAS 2012)', 'description': 'Whole exome sequencing of 58 primary DLBCL samples and their matched normals.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '22343534', 'citation': 'Lohr et al.

To better deﬁne prognostic\\nmarkers in this clinical subset, we investigated our experience of 61 patients\\nwith extremity RMS treated at our tertiary cancer center for the past 2 decades.\\nPATIENTS AND\\nMETHODS\\nThe patients had a median age of 8 years at diagnosis, equal gender distribution,\\nand two-thirds occurred in the lower extremity. Most (85%) patients had FOXO1\\nfusion–positive alveolar RMS (ARMS), with 70% having a PAX3::FOXO1 tran-\\nscript. Remaining were seven patients with fusion-negative embryonal RMS\\n(ERMS) and two with MYOD1-mutant spindle cell/sclerosing RMS (SRMS). In\\n40% of the patients, material was available for DNA-based targeted sequencing\\nusing MSK-IMPACT cancer gene panel.\\nRESULTS\\nOne-third of patients presented with localized disease at diagnosis while the\\nremaining had regional nodal (18%) or distant metastases (51%). Metastatic\\ndisease, high-risk group, and age 10 years or older signiﬁcantly affected the\\noverall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 2.68 [P 5 .004], 2.78 [P 5 .010] and 2.26\\n[P 5 .034], respectively). Although the presence of metastatic disease had a\\ndismal impact on 5-year EFS and OS (19% and 29%, respectively), nodal in-\\nvolvement had a comparatively lower impact on 5-year EFS and 5-year OS (43%\\nand 66%, respectively). PAX3::FOXO1 ARMS had worse prognosis and afﬂicted\\nolder children compared with PAX7::FOXO1 (HR 5 3.45, P 5 .016). The most\\ncommon events in the ARMS group included MED12 alterations, CDK4 ampli-\\nﬁcations, and CDKN2A deletions (8%-17%). The latter two abnormalities were\\nmutually exclusive, enriched for acral and high-risk lesions, and correlated with\\npoor outcome on OS (P 5 .02).\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur data provide rationale for considering the integration of molecular ab-\\nnormalities to reﬁne risk stratiﬁcation in extremity RMS.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most frequent pediatric\\nsoft-tissue sarcoma with a median age at diagnosis of\\n5 years. In the past decade, the ﬁne-tuning of multimodal\\nchemotherapy regimens has greatly improved the relapse-\\nfree\\nsurvival\\nfor\\npatients\\nwith\\nlocalized\\ndiseases.1-3\\nCurrently, 70% of the patients survive with no relapse,\\nhowever, often developing one or more clinically signiﬁ-\\ncant treatment-related toxicities.4\\nRMS of the extremities account for 15% of cases, occur more\\noften in older children, and have an overall poor outcome.5,6\\nThe known prognostic factors for RMS, such as older age and\\nalveolar subtype, also apply to extremity RMS. Moreover, nodal\\ninvolvement has a signiﬁcant impact on overall survival (OS),\\nbeing detected in 33%-43% of patients with extremity RMS\\nand being associated with poor survival rates (9%-32%).7,8\\nRecent publications have highlighted the importance of\\naccurate staging for nodal involvement and adjusted radio-\\ntherapy regimens.1,9 However, the role of molecular markers in\\noutcome prediction for this clinical subset has yet to be in-\\nvestigated. In this study, we investigate a large cohort of pa-\\ntients with extremity RMS treated at our tertiary cancer center\\nfor the past 20 years aiming to better deﬁne clinical, pathologic,\\nand genomic factors that correlate with outcome.\\nACCOMPANYING CONTENT\\nAppendix\\nData Supplement\\nAccepted May 8, 2023\\nPublished June 14, 2023\\nJCO Precis Oncol 7:e2200705\\n© 2023 by American Society of\\nClinical Oncology\\nascopubs.org/journal/po | 1\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC10309566', 'name': 'Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcomas (MSK, JCO Precis Oncol 2023)', 'description': 'Targeted sequencing of 24 cases with extremity rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and their matched normals (MSK Cohort) via MSK-IMPACT.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '37315267', 'citation': 'de Wardin et al.

Clinical and tumor characteristics\\nare summarized in Table 1. In brief, 42 (69%) tumors were\\nlocated in the lower extremity (foot, n 5 10; calf, n 5 15;\\nthigh, n 5 12; buttock, n 5 5) and 19 in the upper extremity\\n(hand, n 5 11; forearm, n 5 8). Tumor size was > 5 cm in 37\\n(60%) cases. Histologic type included 52 (85%) ARMS, seven\\nERMS, and two SRMS. A FOXO1 gene rearrangement and its\\npartner were conﬁrmed in all patients with ARMS, including\\n36 PAX3::FOXO1 and 16 PAX7::FOXO1 cases. The risk groups\\nwere evenly distributed in our cohort, with half of the pa-\\ntients having high-risk disease (30 of 61) while the other half\\nhad low or intermediate risk (31 of 61). Within the ARMS\\nsubgroup, PAX3::FOXO1 were more likely to be high risk (24 of\\n36, 67%) compared with PAX7::FOXO1 counterpart (4 of\\n16, 25%).\\nRegarding stage at presentation, 20 patients had localized\\ndisease (N0, M0), 11 patients had regional nodal involvement\\n(N1, M0), and 31 patients had metastatic disease (N0/1, M1).\\nAs most patients in this speciﬁc cohort had ARMS disease,\\nrisk stratiﬁcation was predominantly dependent on the\\npresence or absence of distant metastatic spread. Metastatic\\nsites included bone marrow (17 of 31), bone (16 of 31) lung\\n(3 of 31), in-transit (1 of 31), breast (2 of 31), distant nodes\\nonly (3 of 31), and other thoracoabdominal organs (7 of 31).\\nBone metastasis was most frequently found in extremity,\\niliac, vertebrae, skull base, and orbit. Nodal involvement\\nalone was found in 27% (8 of 30) of high-risk patients.\\nOne patient with ERMS (<1 year) considered at his local\\ninstitution to have metastatic disease (suspicious lung\\nnodule) was subsequently determined to be eligible for\\nenrollment on the then-current COG intermediate risk trial,\\nARST-1431. Local control was achieved by radical limb-\\npreservation surgery without radiation therapy, and no\\nwhole-lung radiation was delivered. Disease relapses in the\\nintermediate-risk group occurred in 45% (13 of 29) of pa-\\ntients and were more likely to be regional (46%—6 of 13)\\nthan metastatic (38%—5 of 13). Two patients experienced\\nlocal relapse. One of them did not receive primary local\\ncontrol treatment because of parental refusal.\\nLymphoscintigraphy-guided sentinel node mapping and\\nsampling was done for 72% of patients (44 of 61).

This aggressive biology is likely driven\\nby two main factors: a high incidence of ARMS, which in our\\nseries accounted for 85% of extremity tumors (70% being\\nPAX3-positive), and a high incidence of metastatic disease at\\npresentation, which represented the majority of our cohort,\\nwith either isolated regional nodal (16%) or distant meta-\\nstatic (51%) disease. For the group as a whole, the successful\\nlocal control management of the primary tumor with ﬁrst-\\nline radiotherapy approach was seen in more than 90% of\\npatients, and for those with localized tumors, local control\\nwas achieved in 95% of patients. The by-far greatest risk of\\ntreatment failure in this group of patients, then, is the in-\\nability of multimodal therapy to control occult or established\\nregional nodal and/or distant metastatic disease.\\nRegarding local control, results from the IRS-IV trial de-\\nscribe 7% local failure rates, 20% regional, and 28% distant\\ncontrol failure in localized extremity RMS.24 The D9803 trial\\nshowed 15% local failure rates for similar patient population,\\nfurther highlighting the unfavorable impact of extremity\\nlocation on RMS relapse.25 Moreover, this study reveals that\\npatients with ARMS and clinical group I/II tumors are as-\\nsociated with excellent local control rates but experience\\nincreased distant failures. This underscores that more\\naggressive up-front surgery is unlikely to improve the\\noutcome in this patients’ subset, whose leading risk of\\ntreatment failure is regional nodes and/or distant metastatic\\nrecurrence. In contrast, a recent French study focusing on\\nlocalized extremity RMS reported that most relapses were\\nlocoregional and describing a local control failure rate of\\n27%.6 This study included patients treated in the MMT-95\\nprotocol in which routine systematic irradiation was not\\nprovided in patients showing good disease response to\\nchemotherapy and surgery. This could explain the dis-\\ncrepancy between European and North American local\\ncontrol rates. The results of our localized subset show very\\nsimilar ﬁndings to those of the Donaldson and Wolden\\npublications, having a 5-year EFS of 58%, a 5-year OS of\\n84%, and a majority of metastatic relapses (63%). Our local\\ncontrol failure rate was low, with 7% (4 of 61) for our whole\\ncohort and 5% (1 of 21) for the localized disease subset (see\\nAppendix).\\nThe presence of nodal involvement, surprisingly, had a lower\\nimpact on the 5-year EFS and 5-year OS (43% and 66%,\\nrespectively) comparatively to the dismal impact of meta-\\nstatic disease (19% and 29%, respectively). Previous data\\nsuggested that patients with N1 RMS should be managed\\nsimilarly as M1 patients, as they have shown comparable\\nsurvival rates.26 Although nodal involvement alone did not\\nqualify for high-risk classiﬁcation and therapy in our data\\nset, the difference in survival may be related to the ag-\\ngressive treatment of nodal disease by systematic radio-\\ntherapy and surgery. An accurate diagnosis of locoregional\\nspread seems, therefore, essential to increase survival. In-\\ndeed, 56% of our cohort had lymph node involvement at\\ndiagnosis, further highlighting the importance of an in-\\ndepth attempt to identify disseminated disease in extrem-\\nity RMS. We recommend that 18F-FDG-PET/CT and sentinel\\nnode mapping be used as standard of care for risk stratiﬁ-\\ncation. Systematic biopsy of regional lymphatic drainage\\nbasins and/or suspicious (enlarged or hypermetabolic) nodes\\nhas also been proven of high added value. Our series conﬁrm\\nthe joint efﬁciency achieved by concomitant techniques as\\nsome patients showed nodal involvement on imaging only\\nwhile others could solely be seen by sentinel nodal sampling.\\nThe combined use of these three techniques could greatly\\nincrease the average sensitivity (61%) of PET/CT when used\\nfor positive lymph node detection,8 especially in extremity\\nRMS. Nodal involvement has been reported in 5%-10% of all\\npediatric and adolescent RMS.27\\nThe high incidence of ARMS subtype (>80%) in the extremity\\nRMS may explain the disproportionally high rate of dis-\\nseminated disease at diagnosis in our study (41 of 61, 67%)\\nand thus the unfavorable outcome detected with extremity\\nlocation. The experience provided by prophylactic nodal ir-\\nradiation (PNI) seemed encouraging as all patients (n 5 4)\\nwho beneﬁted from it did not relapse compared with a 50%\\n5-year EFS of comparable cases. Although based on very small\\nnumbers, these data are encouraging and, to our knowledge,\\nrepresent the ﬁrst report of PNI-positive impact on survival in\\nTABLE 2.

CDKN2A loss of\\nfunction has been shown to considerably increase tumor\\nsusceptibility in a knock-in Pax3-Foxo1 mouse model.32\\nMoreover, in a stepwise in vitro study, p16INK4A/p14ARF\\nloss of function was a necessary partner to PAX3::FOXO1 gain\\nof function leading to a synergetic action of early cell pro-\\nliferation while MYCN ampliﬁcation and hTERT stabilization\\nwere late events leading to tumors in vivo.33 More recently\\nand similar to our ﬁndings, the enrichment of CDK4 and\\nCDKN2A copy number aberrations has been described in\\npatients with ARMS, with data suggesting a mutually ex-\\nclusive pattern34,35 and an adverse impact of CDKN2A loss on\\nsurvival.36 Moreover, our results showed that the presence of\\neither CDK4 ampliﬁcation or CDKN2A deletion correlated\\nwith high-risk patients and had an adverse impact on OS. Of\\ninterest only one ERMS in our cohort tested by targeted NGS\\nshowed the presence of TP53 deletion, which co-occurred\\nwith RB and FGRF4 deletions. None of the extremity ARMS\\ntested showed the presence of TP53 mutations. Overall, the\\nnumber of secondary genetic events outside the FOXO1\\nfusion-driver was relatively low (range of 1-9 gene alter-\\nations, average 3.5-3.7), thus highlighting relatively few\\npotential\\ntherapeutic\\ntargets\\nfor\\na\\nmore\\npersonalized\\ntreatment (see Appendix).\\nIn summary, we report our clinical and genomic experience on\\none of the largest cohort of extremity RMS treated at a single\\ntertiary cancer center. Our study was driven by unanswered\\nquestions regarding the disproportionally poor outcome of\\nthis clinical subset compared with other RMS locations and\\nhypothesized that genomic landscape analyses may provide\\nadditional insights into their distinct pathogenesis. In keeping\\nwith previous data, we conﬁrm that metastatic spread at\\ndiagnosis, risk group, and FOXO1 fusion subtype remain the\\nmost critical and signiﬁcant actors of poor survival rates.\\nA\\nNo. at risk:\\nP = .029\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n0\\n0.5\\n1\\n1.5\\n2\\n2.5\\n3.5\\n4\\n4.5\\n5\\n5.5\\n6\\nTime (years)\\nOS (probability)\\n3\\nCDKN2A/CDK4 altered (n = 5)\\nCDKN2A/CDK4 unaltered (n = 13)\\n4\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n8\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nB\\nNo. at risk:\\nP = .04\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\n0\\n0.5\\n1\\n1.5\\n2\\n2.5\\n3.5\\n4\\n4.5\\n5\\n5.5\\n6\\nOS (probability)\\nCDKN2A/CDK4 altered (n = 4)\\nCDKN2A/CDK4 unaltered (n = 9)\\nTime (years)\\n3\\n4\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n8\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nFIG 3.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy arising in salivary glands and other sites, characterized \\nby high rates of relapse and distant spread. Recurrent/metastatic (R/M) ACCs are generally incurable, due to a lack of \\nactive systemic therapies. To improve outcomes, deeper understanding of genetic alterations and vulnerabilities in R/M \\ntumors is needed.\\nMETHODS. An integrated genomic analysis of 1,045 ACCs (177 primary, 868 R/M) was performed to identify alterations \\nassociated with advanced and metastatic tumors. Intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, germline mutations, and therapeutic \\nactionability were assessed.\\nRESULTS. Compared with primary tumors, R/M tumors were enriched for alterations in key Notch (NOTCH1, 26.3% vs. 8.5%; \\nNOTCH2, 4.6% vs. 2.3%; NOTCH3, 5.7% vs. 2.3%; NOTCH4, 3.6% vs. 0.6%) and chromatin-remodeling (KDM6A, 15.2% vs. \\n3.4%; KMT2C/MLL3, 14.3% vs. 4.0%; ARID1B, 14.1% vs. 4.0%) genes. TERT promoter mutations (13.1% of R/M cases) were \\nmutually exclusive with both NOTCH1 mutations (q = 3.3 × 10–4) and MYB/MYBL1 fusions (q = 5.6 × 10–3), suggesting discrete, \\nalternative mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This network of alterations defined 4 distinct ACC subgroups: MYB+NOTCH1+, \\nMYB+/other, MYBWTNOTCH1+, and MYBWTTERT+.

Predominantly \\narising within salivary glands, ACCs may also originate in the tra-\\nchea, lung, breast, and other sites. ACC tumors are treated with \\nsurgery and adjuvant radiation therapy (1), but most cases are \\ncharacterized by perineural invasion and distant spread that may \\ndevelop over years to decades. More than 50% of ACCs recur or \\ndevelop distant metastases over time. Relapsed tumors are gener-\\nally incurable because no systemic agents to date have been found \\nto be effective. Therefore, overall prognosis has remained poor, \\nwith long-term overall survival (OS) rates of 23%–40% (2).\\nOur knowledge to date of the molecular alterations underlying \\nACC have been based on several small studies of mainly primary \\ntumors, which have revealed a relatively quiet genome (3, 4), with \\nprevalent alterations including MYB or MYBL1 translocations \\n(28%–59%) (2, 5–7) and a long tail of less frequent mutations (8) \\nthat may drive pathogenesis. Recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) \\nACC has not been well characterized, and it remains unknown \\nwhich molecular alterations drive its propensity for metastasis \\n(9). Further progress in the treatment of R/M ACC will require a \\nmore comprehensive understanding of the molecular alterations \\nassociated with aggressive tumor behavior. Here, we evaluate the \\ncomparative genomic landscapes of primary versus R/M ACC in \\n1045 sequenced cases, a cohort size that approximates the annu-\\nal incidence of ACC in the United States (approximately 1200 per \\nyear). In R/M ACCs, we identify distinct mutational enrichments, \\npatterns of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, and pathogenic \\ngermline alterations, which together reveal previously unrecog-\\nnized aspects of the “quiet” ACC genome. Taken together, our \\nfindings help define a framework governing ACC progression and \\nguide next steps for clinical investigation.\\n"), Document(page_content="Results\\nMutational data were compiled in aggregate on 1045 ACC cases \\n(177 primary tumors in patients with localized disease and 868 \\ncases with R/M disease) (Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemen-\\ntal Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; \\nhttps:/\\n/doi.org/10.1172/JCI128227DS1).

In both \\ncases, the MYB-NFIB fusion was present and clonal throughout all \\nsampled regions, and in 1 case, a clonal NOTCH1 mutation was \\npresent in both regions, indicating the importance of these alter-\\nations to tumorigenesis. Concurrently, distinct subclonal muta-\\ntions unique to high-grade regions were identified, supporting the \\nemergence of subclonal mutations associated with progression to \\naggressive histology (Supplemental Figure 10).\\nThese findings demonstrate that the “quiet” genome of ACCs, \\nwith a low mutational load, belies a more genetically heteroge-\\nneous tumor, with subclonal mutations detectable in a subset \\n(34.5%) of tumors sequenced in bulk at standard depth and evi-\\ndence of branching evolution across spatial regions within the pri-\\nmary tumor and during the development of metastases. In the 1 \\nmultiregion sequenced case, the number of mutations discernible \\nin bulk tumor sequencing (even at a very high depth of ×5000) \\nrepresented less than half of the mutations observed in aggre-\\ngate across all tumor sites. All 3 studied cases, despite having the \\ncanonical MYB-NFIB fusion (presumed to be the early, underpin-\\nning driver of tumorigenesis), displayed clonal evolution involving \\nthe acquisition and selection of recognized mutations that likely \\nin turn support disease progression. Such findings are consistent \\nwith that of spatiotemporal mutational gain by Liu et al. (24) and \\nsuggest that the propensity of ACCs to metastasize may be attrib-\\nutable to a surprising degree of tumor genetic heterogeneity, an \\nessential substrate for branching evolution in cancer.\\nACCs harbor distinct pathogenic germline mutations.

This \\ntreatment resistance is further compounded by \\nACC’s rarity and its unpredictable, heterogeneous \\nspectrum of disease virulence. Until now, clinical \\nand translational research in ACC has been limit-\\ned by an incomplete understanding of the molec-\\nular alterations associated with aggressive disease: \\nin a tumor with such a quiet genome, what factors \\ndrive high rates of relapse and distant metastasis? \\nHere, we present a molecular analysis of the largest \\ncohort to date of R/M ACC and compare it with a \\nsizeable cohort of primary ACC, extending initial \\nobservations and identifying relationships that may \\nhelp guide the next steps of clinical investigation.\\nWe identified a number of mutations in cancer \\ngenes that were enriched in R/M ACCs (Figure 1), \\nwhich belies the standard description of ACC as a \\ntumor with a quiet genome. Compared with prima-\\nry ACC tumors, in which NOTCH1 mutations are \\nuncommon, we observed evidence of strong selec-\\ntive pressure for NOTCH1 mutations in R/M cases, \\n26.3% of which harbored this alteration (18.3% had \\nactivating mutations). Similarly, multiple genes \\ninvolved in chromatin modification (KDM, MLL, \\nARID family of genes) were enriched for mutation in \\nR/M cases (12.8%–15.2%).\\nNOTCH1 has been studied as both an onco-\\ngene and tumor suppressor across numerous \\ntumor types, and dysregulation of its signaling pathway is \\nincreasingly recognized as a driver for ACC pathogenesis. Acti-\\nvating NOTCH1 mutations have been previously observed in one \\ncohort as associated with poor prognosis in ACC, including solid \\nhistology, liver/bone metastasis, and decreased survival (8). We \\nsimilarly observed that activating NOTCH1 mutations are asso-\\nciated with poor prognosis (Figure 4) and, furthermore, identi-\\nfed alterations in other members of the Notch family (NOTCH2, \\nNOTCH3, NOTCH4) (3.6%–5.7%) as well as genes that acti-\\nvate the Notch-signaling pathway, including SPEN (6.7%) and \\nFBXW7 (3.8%). Collectively, such findings solidify the Notch \\npathway as a central mediator of ACC pathogenesis. Given the \\naugmented presence of Notch alterations in the R/M setting \\nand the association with poor prognosis, these mutations may \\nmore specifically facilitate metastatic relapse or mediate disease \\naggressiveness. The use of γ secretase inhibitors, which prevent \\ncleavage and impede Notch activation, is therefore a promising \\nnymized fashion. A total of 38 pathogenic germline mutations \\nwere identified, with a mean 0.42 pathogenic variants per sample \\n(Supplemental Table 8). Notably, 33 (36.7%) R/M samples were \\nobserved to harbor at least 1 pathogenic germline mutation. The \\nvast majority comprised splicing mutations (94.7%), while frame-\\nshift insertions (5.3%) made up the remainder. Thirty-one muta-\\ntions (34.4%) were found to be potentially clinically actionable, \\nand 30 (33.3%) were high penetrance in nature. Twenty mutations \\n(22.2%) represented germline alterations in DNA-repair pathways; \\nspecifically, 4 samples (4.4%) were found to harbor mutations in \\nBRCA1 (c.5152+20T>A, c.5406+8T>C, c.5332+3A>G) or BRCA2 \\n(c.9257–16T>C).

Regardless, such findings of chromatin regulator \\ndysfunction partnered with NOTCH1 alterations in ACC suggest \\nthat epigenetic mechanisms may promote progression via Notch \\npathway manipulation.

It is interesting \\nthat within the context of cancer, NOTCH1 and TERT engage in \\nlargely distinct biologic pathways.

The activity of these agents in Notch-mutant \\nACCs is currently under active investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov \\nNCT03691207, NCT03422679, NCT01695005).\\nOne possibility suggested by data in this cohort is that of \\ncooperativity between NOTCH1 and chromatin-remodeling path-\\nways, considered gatekeepers to cellular homeostasis and also \\ntumorigenesis (26). While mutations within this family have been \\npreviously reported, the consistently higher rate of alterations \\nacross multiple key genes (e.g., KDM6A, ARID1A, ARID1B, MLL2, \\nMLL3, BCOR, CREBBP, EP300) among our R/M cases suggests \\na contributing role to ACC progression. CREBBP and EP300 in \\nparticular are known coactivators of MYB, binding to its central \\ntransactivation domain to modulate its function (27). Correla-\\ntive histone aceytyltransferases and demethylases are similarly \\ninvolved in recruiting NOTCH1 transcriptional regulators during \\nthe binding of the Notch transcriptional complex (NTC) with the \\nNotch intracellular domain (NICD) (28–30). We observed a strik-\\ning cooccurrence between mutations in NOTCH1 and a number of \\nchromatin-remodeling genes (Figure 3A). Cooccurrence between \\n2 alterations may imply possible biological synergy, whereby only \\ndysfunction in both genes may lead to cancer (31, 32). It is also pos-\\nFigure 7.

We focused our analysis on R/M \\npatients with tumor and matched normal tissue, employing a \\ntargeted 76-gene panel that incorporates cancer susceptibility \\ntargets. Such selective germline analysis has been suggested for \\nthose tumor types with high predisposition, such as prostate cancer \\n(42), and universal germline testing has been proposed for certain \\nmalignancies (43). Interestingly, nearly one-third of R/M ACC \\npatients in our study harbored a pathogenic germline variant. The \\nmajority of these alterations would not have been detected through \\nstandard genetics evaluation and testing based on current clinical \\nguidelines. While anonymization of our data precluded further cor-\\nrelative analyses with clinical outcomes, such knowledge of these \\nadditional mutations may further influence preventive or thera-\\npeutic decision making. We caution that only a subset (90 patients) \\nof the total cohort underwent germline sequencing and only in an \\nanonymized fashion. Moreover, to date, only one potentially famil-\\nial case has been reported (44) in what is otherwise considered a \\nnoninheritable malignancy, and the penetrance of these alterations \\nin salivary tissues is not known. Although 4 mutations in BRCA1/2 \\nwere identified, these appeared monoallelic and therefore have \\nunclear clinical relevance. These preliminary results require fur-\\nther validation in additional data sets before recommending uni-\\nversal germline analysis in ACC patients.\\nA number of caveats limit the generalizability of our find-\\nings. The lack of clinical data for many cases, including stage, \\nhistology, type of metastasis, and survival outcomes, precluded \\nmore detailed clinical analyses. Because ACC is an orphan dis-\\nease, sequenced tumors were contributed by a number of institu-\\ntions and sequenced on different WES, WGS, and targeted NGS \\nplatforms. Although our downsampling analysis confirmed that \\nsequencing depth did not seem to affect sensitivity of mutation \\ndetection, we note that the presence of these different platforms \\nlimited our ability to analyze certain features, such as TMB or \\ngerm\\xad\\nline mutations in all tumors.\\nIn addition, MYB/MLB1 status, a known driver of ACC patho-\\ngenesis, though not of prognosis, was not available for all patients. \\nAs noted above, MYB rearrangements were primarily assessed on \\nthe basis of breakpoints in intron 14 of MYB. While this would be \\nexpected to capture the vast majority of MYB fusions involving NFIB \\nor other partners (5), it is now understood that most ACC tumors \\noverexpress MYB, even in the absence of MYB-NFIB fusions, either \\nthrough other fusion partners, MYBL1 fusions, or other mecha-\\nnisms (41, 45, 46). Therefore, the cases categorized as MYBWT are \\nmost accurately considered as negative for translocations involving \\nMYB intron 14, but some cases may overexpress MYB through other \\nmeans. MYBL1 in particular was not assessed in NGS panels. Nev-\\nertheless, we found that the degree of mutual exclusivity between \\nMYB/MYBL1 and TERT promoter mutations remained unchanged \\nin those samples assessed for translocations more comprehensively \\nwith FISH, indicating that profiling of intron 14 is likely to be rep-\\nresentative of interactions among the common alterations in ACC. \\nUltimately, these observations synthesize the largest data set of \\nACC to date, identifying molecular relationships and pathways to \\nbetter characterize and target an enigmatic, understudied cancer.\\nIn summary, we identify key genomic drivers in a large-scale \\nR/M ACC analysis, highlighting enrichment in NOTCH signaling, \\nIt is important to note that, although MYB/MYBL1 alter-\\nations are prevalent in R/M cases, we did not observe clear asso-\\nciations among MYB status, R/M status, and survival (36). Yet \\nby integrating the above findings, we observed that a network of \\nalterations targeting MYB, NOTCH1, and TERT defines several \\nmolecular subgroups that together account for the majority of \\nR/M ACC tumors: MYB+NOTCH1+, MYB+/other, MYBWTTERT+, \\nand MYBWTNOTCH1+ (Figure 3, B and C). Broad therapeutic prog-\\nress in treating R/M ACC will undoubtedly depend on efforts to \\ntarget each of these key genes.\\nIn addition, more than 40% of R/M cases contained mutations \\nin tyrosine kinases, potentially targetable with clinically available \\nkinase inhibitors. However, only a fraction of these alterations have \\nclinical evidence supporting their use as biomarkers in cancer. One \\nphase II study of the multikinase inhibitor axitinib demonstrated \\npotential benefit for ACC patients with 4q12 amplification (37). \\nMore recently, 2 phase II studies of the multikinase inhibitor lenva-\\ntinib in patients with R/M ACC reported an overall response rate of \\n16%–27% (38, 39), confirming that this approach has the potential \\nto demonstrate clinical benefit in ACC patients. These data suggest \\nthat therapeutic approaches that are not directed by genomic data \\nmay have limited benefit in tumors such as ACC and that predic-\\ntive biomarkers are needed to improve response rates.\\nAnother factor driving ACC tumor progression is ITH, which \\nwe found was more common than might be expected for a tumor \\ntype that generally harbors so few mutations. ITH in cancers \\nresults from the expansion of SCPs under selective pressure. More \\nbroadly, ITH may be an indication of a tumor’s fitness for evolu-\\ntionary adaptation and at high levels associates with poorer sur-\\nvival across diverse cancer types (18). These later subclonal events \\nappear to occur independently of early or “trunk” alterations, \\nwhich may initiate pathogenesis but not propagate it. Despite a \\nquiet genome, evidence from these cases indicates that many pri-\\nmary ACCs nonetheless harbor SCPs that approximate this model \\nof evolution (24) and may drive progression (Supplemental Figure \\n5). Even in tumors sequenced in bulk at standard depth, there was \\nclear evidence of ITH in approximately one-third of cases, with a \\ndistribution very similar to that observed in hormone receptor–\\npositive breast cancer (18).\\nThe multiregion molecular portrait of the primary and meta-\\nstatic tumor samples from one patient captured over time further \\nillustrated this genomic evolution, where MYB-NFIB fusion was a \\nclonal event, yet subclonal events were associated with metastat-\\nic spread. Deep sequencing and NMF clustering analysis depicted \\n1 cluster comprising exclusively metastatic lesions with distinct \\nmutations (SF3B1, XDH, LTF, TMEM2) that may promote metasta-\\nsis (Figure 7). SF3B1 mutations are well established in cancer, con-\\ntributing to alternative splicing and implicated in late metastasis in \\nuveal melanoma (19), while XDH mutations have been shown to \\npromote migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (20). \\nLTF mutations affect cell motility, while TMEM2 (also known as \\nCEMIP2) mutations appear to confer proinvasive and promigratory \\npotential: both genes are known to be associated with breast cancer \\nmetastasis (21, 22). Collectively, such SCPs that drive relapse and \\nmetastasis may illustrate why known players such as MYB them-\\nselves do not appear to confer poor prognosis (40, 41) or compre-\\nhensively explain ACC’s heterogeneous, protracted disease course.\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC6763222', 'name': 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Project (J Clin Invest 2019)', 'description': 'Multi-Institute Cohort of 1045 Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma patients.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '31483290', 'citation': 'Allen et al.

The results were tabulated and plotted as a comparison of \\nVAF between downsampled BAM files and the original IMPACT BAM \\nfiles (Supplemental Figure 4).\\nIntratumoral genetic heterogeneity.

MSI scores of \\nless than 3 were considered microsatellite stable, while MSI scores from \\n3–10 were considered indeterminate, and scores greater than 10 were \\nconsidered microsatellite unstable. In any cases indeterminate on MSI-\\nSensor, further orthogonal analysis was performed using MiMSI (75), \\na multiple instance machine-learning technique to analyze reads from \\nmicrosatellite sites. BRCA1/BRCA2 second-hit analysis was performed \\nvia FACETS (16) by matching tumor and normal-sequencing files in an \\nanonymized fashion by a researcher unconnected with this study.\\nTherapeutic actionability and clinical levels of evidence. Each somat-\\nic alteration in the 1045 ACC tumors was separately annotated using \\nOncoKB, a precision oncology database that annotates tumor alter-\\nations by levels of clinical evidence supporting the use of that mutant \\nallele or other alteration as a predictive biomarker of drug sensitivity \\nto FDA-approved or investigational agents (64).\\nStatistics. Clinical, demographic, and pathologic information \\nwas collected on all 94 MSKCC R/M ACC patients undergoing treat-\\nment at MSKCC. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.3 \\n(SAS Institute). Estimated survival functions were generated via the \\nKaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. All statis-\\ntical tests were 2 sided, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered \\nstatistically significant.\\nStudy approval. Protocol approval for specimen collection and \\nDNA sequencing was obtained by each respective institution’s IRB. \\nFoundation Medicine received additional IRB approval, including \\na waiver of informed consent and a HIPAA waiver of authorization, \\nfrom the Western IRB. The MSKCC IRB provided approval for the \\nanalysis of MSKCC patient data as well as the analysis of deidenti-\\nfied data provided from other institutions, including a data transfer \\nagreement with Foundation Medicine. Written, informed consent was \\nobtained from participants prior to inclusion in the study.\\nData availability. The complete genetic data from all cases will be \\npublicly available in cbioportal.org at the time of publication (http:/\\n/\\nwww.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=acc_2019) (76, 77).\\nAuthor contributions\\nLGTM, NS, and TAC were responsible for study conception. \\nLGTM and NS were responsible for data acquisition and trans-\\nfer agreements. AO, GJ, AZ, VM, JSRF, BW, NS, TAC, and LGTM \\ncarried out bioinformatics analyses; ASH, JT, and LGTM carried \\nout statistical analyses; ASH, ALH, JT, CVM, and LGTM carried \\nout clinical data analysis; and SD and NK carried out pathologic \\nanalysis. MGD and LGTM processed biospecimens. ASH, TAC, \\nand LGTM wrote the manuscript, and all authors interpreted data \\nand reviewed the manuscript. JH, MB, MM, JSR, VAM, LC, IG, PT, \\nPH, NA, DBS, PAF, and AKEN interpreted data and reviewed the \\n(17). All samples harboring 5 or more mutations were included, and \\nintratumor heterogeneity was quantified as the number of genomi-\\ncally distinct clonal or SCPs in each sample, where an SCP represents \\nthe outcome of a clonal expansion and is inferred from 2 or more \\nmutations with similar cellular prevalence using a Bayesian clustering \\napproach. A cluster was considered subclonal if the CCF upper CI was \\ngreater than 95% (18). Additional qualitative assessment of NOTCH1 \\nmutations across all cases was carried out by plotting a variant allelic \\nfrequency (VAF) density histogram for those cases with diploid copy \\nnumber in the NOTCH1 region.\\nMultiregion intratumoral heterogeneity in clinically aggressive ACC. \\nClonal evolution was further investigated in a single adult salivary \\nACC patient who developed multifocal distant lung metastases (over \\n90 distinct lesions) 4 years after definitive therapy (parotidectomy \\nwith postoperative proton beam radiation). WES was performed on \\nthe primary tumor and 8 distant metastases, with mean target cover-\\nage of ×140 and SNVs called as described previously (3). Mutations \\nthen underwent orthogonal validation via ultra-deep sequencing in \\nthe primary tumor, 6 spatial subregions of the primary tumor, the 8 \\ndistant metastatic lesions, and matched normal DNA from peripheral \\nblood, via a custom targeted NGS AmpliSeq library on the Ion Torrent \\nPGM platform (68, 69). An Ion AmpliSeq custom panel was designed \\nwith an Ion AmpliSeq Designer (Thermo Fisher) for 165 amplicons \\ntargeting the regions of interest. After PicoGreen quantification and \\nquality control by Agilent TapeStation, 20 ng of DNA was used to pre-\\npare libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 and Ion Xpress \\nBarcode Adapters 1–16 Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocols, \\nwith 17 cycles of PCR and final extension of 6 minutes. Emulsion \\nPCR was carried out with the Ion OneTouch System and Ion Hi-Q \\nOT2 Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After the emulsion \\nPCR, template-positive Ion Sphere Particles were enriched with the \\nDynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 Beads. Sequencing was then per-\\nformed with an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) system \\nusing the Ion PGM HiQ Sequencing Kit and Ion 318 Chip. Mean depth \\nof coverage was ×5406.\\nSequencing data were aligned using BWA and Picard/GATK \\nto mark duplicates, and HaplotypeCaller, version 2.3.9, was used to \\nannotate variants (51). The ultra-deep sequencing data, together with \\nFACETS, version 0.5 (16), was used to adjust for tumor purity and ploi-\\ndy, and CCF was determined using PyClone as described above (17). \\nAll mutations with VAF greater than 0.01 and CCF less than 2% were \\nincluded. NMF clustering of CCF was performed in GenePattern (70). \\nSimilar analyses of the 2 breast ACCs with high-grade triple-negative \\ntransformation were performed on their published mutation calls and \\ncopy number findings (23) using PyClone.\\nTo assess the clonality of the MYB-NFIB translocation, FISH \\nwas performed using a 3-color probe mix consisting of bacterial arti-\\nficial chromosomes (BACs) for 5′ MYB (RP11-614H6, RP11-104D9; \\ngreen), 3′ MYB (RP11-323N12, RP11-1060C14; orange), and 3′ NFIB \\n(RP11-413D24, RP11-589C16; red). Probe labeling, tissue processing, \\nhybridization, posthybridization washing, and fluorescence detection \\nwere performed as previously described (3). FISH signals were imaged \\nthrough the depth of the tissue, and a minimum of 50 discrete nuclei \\nwere analyzed within the marked regions.\\nGermline analysis. Data from MSK-IMPACT sequenced R/M \\ntumors were anonymized and underwent secondary germline analy-\\nsis. Germline analysis was performed on normal DNA from peripher-\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC6763222', 'name': 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Project (J Clin Invest 2019)', 'description': 'Multi-Institute Cohort of 1045 Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma patients.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '31483290', 'citation': 'Allen et al.

Increasingly, cancers are classiﬁed by\\nthe ensemble of mutant genes they harbor; targeting\\nsuch genes with selective inhibitors has resulted in\\nprofound clinical impact in lung adenocarcinomas\\nwith EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK rearrange-\\nments, BRAF-mutant melanomas, and in several\\nadditional genetically deﬁned solid tumors.2-5 The\\nextent, duration, and rates of response for many of\\nthese examples are unprecedented and have led to\\nrapid drug approval in molecularly deﬁned pa-\\ntient subsets.\\nWith the goal of accelerating the adoption of a\\nprecision medicine-based approach for patients\\nwith advanced bladder cancer, we performed an in-\\ntegrated genomic analysis to deﬁne the prevalence\\nand patterns of co-occurrence of therapeutically\\ntractable genomic alterations in 97 high-grade\\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY\\nO R I G I N A L\\nR E P O R T\\nVOLUME\\n31\\n\\x01\\nNUMBER\\n25\\n\\x01\\nSEPTEMBER\\n1\\n2013\\n© 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\\n3133\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3753703', 'name': 'Bladder Cancer (MSK, J Clin Onco 2013)', 'description': 'Comprehensive profiling of 97 high-grade bladder tumors, including targeted sequencing of 15 cancer genes', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '23897969', 'citation': 'Iyer et al.

Only serous ovarian cancers demonstrated a\\ngreater degree of mean structural aberration than the high-burden\\nCNA bladder tumors. In contrast, the degree of structural aberration\\nin the low-burden CNA bladder cancers was similar to hypermutated\\nuterine endometrioid and prostate cancers and greater only than\\nhypermutated colorectal cancers. Although two subsets of genetically\\ndistincttumorscouldbedeﬁnedbyCNAburden,thesedidnotdeﬁne\\nclinically distinct disease subsets. Speciﬁcally, there was no signiﬁcant\\ndifferenceintherateofrecurrence-free,OS,orcancer-speciﬁcsurvival\\nbetween the two groups (P \\x02 .98, P \\x02 .75, and P \\x02 .49, respectively),\\nwith both demonstrating a high bladder cancer–speciﬁc mortality\\n(Data Supplement).\\nTo identify recurrent, functionally signiﬁcant CNAs that may\\nrepresent driver events, we used the statistical method RAE (Fig 1C;\\nDataSupplement).Notableregionsofampliﬁcationincluded11q13.2\\nto 13.3 spanning the CCND1 gene and the 17q12 locus encoding the\\nERBB2 gene. The most commonly deleted locus was 9p21.3 spanning\\nthe CDKN2A and CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes. The most fre-\\nquentarm-lengthgainsandlosseswere20q(41.2%)and11p(36.1%),\\nrespectively. These results are consistent with the results of previous\\narray-based studies that identiﬁed partial or complete loss of chromo-\\nsome 9 as well as 20q and 17q21 gain as common events in blad-\\nder cancer.11-13\\nBecause alterations in gene copy number represent only one\\nmechanism of oncoprotein dysregulation, we performed mutation\\nproﬁling of all 97 tumors. Using a mass spectrometry–based Seque-\\nnom iPLEX assay, we detected hotspot alterations in select cancer\\ngenes.6,7 Sanger sequencing of all coding exons of 15 oncogenes and\\ntumor suppressor genes, selected for their potential as predictive bio-\\nmarkers of response to targeted agents, was also performed (Data\\nSupplement). Sixty-three samples (65%) harbored mutations in at\\nleast one gene, the most prevalent of which were TP53 (34%), FGFR3\\n(13%), and PIK3CA (18%). Integration of mutation and copy num-\\nber data revealed that TP53 and RB1 alterations were signiﬁcantly\\nmore common in high-burden CNA tumors (P \\x01 .001 and P \\x01 .003,\\nrespectively; Fig 1A). Correlations between survival, stage, neoadju-\\nvant chemotherapy, and select aberrations are described in the\\nData Supplement.\\nTo better deﬁne the co-occurrence pattern of mutations and\\nCNAs, we grouped genes into core signal transduction pathways or\\ncanonicalcellfunctions.MAPKpathwayalterationswereidentiﬁedin\\n35% of samples (Fig 2A). The most commonly altered genes were\\nFGFR1,FGFR3,ERBB2,MET,NF1,KRAS,andBRAF,eachoccurring\\nin 2% to 13% of patients and arising in a predominantly mutually\\nexclusivepattern,suggestingthattheseeventsconferoverlappingphe-\\nnotypiceffects.BecauseERBB2ampliﬁcationisavalidateddrugtarget\\nin breast and esophogastric tumors,14-16 we further explored the sig-\\nniﬁcance of the ERBB2 ampliﬁcations (six patients [6.2%]) in our\\ntumor cohort. Focal ERBB2-ampliﬁed tumors were found to exhibit\\nincreased ERBB2 messenger RNA expression as compared with\\nnonampliﬁed samples and 3\\x03 HER2 protein overexpression by im-\\nmunohistochemistry (Figs 2B and 2C).\\nConsistent with studies of other solid tumors,17,18 TP53 muta-\\ntion and MDM2 (which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53)\\nampliﬁcation occurred in a nonoverlapping distribution (Fig 3A).\\nAlterationingenesthatregulateG1-Sphasetransitionwerealsohighly\\nprevalent (60% of all tumors analyzed; Fig 3B). Speciﬁcally, mutually\\nexclusive focal ampliﬁcations of CCND1 and CCNE1 were present in\\n14% and 5% of samples, respectively, and were inversely correlated\\nwith the presence of RB1 mutations or deletions. A similar pattern of\\nmutual exclusivity was not observed among these three genes and\\nE2F3 ampliﬁcation (21%) or CDKN2A deletion or mutation (24%).\\nAmpliﬁcation of the E2F3 locus was notable, because ampliﬁca-\\ntion of this region rarely occurs in other epithelial tumor types (21% v\\n4.9% of 1,932 nonurothelial epithelial tumors) and was associated\\nwith more advanced stage (28% stage III to IV v 6.7% stage I to II;\\nP\\x02.028).19Thus,E2F3ampliﬁcationmayrepresentalineage-speciﬁc\\nevent in bladder cancer, similar to MITF ampliﬁcation in metastatic\\nmelanoma. To assess the functional impact of E2F3 ampliﬁcations in\\nbladder cancer, we calculated an E2F3 activity score from the expres-\\nsion levels of 23 experimentally validated E2F3 target genes20 (Data\\nSupplement). Tumor samples with E2F3 ampliﬁcations or RB1 mu-\\ntations or homozygous deletions exhibited high E2F3 signature scores\\n(Fig 3B). Samples with CCND1 or CCNE1 ampliﬁcation had, on\\naverage, lower E2F3 signature scores, whereas tumors with either\\nCDKN2A alterations or those lacking alterations in all ﬁve genes ex-\\nhibited the lowest scores. Nevertheless, the latter group of wild-type\\ntumors expressed the E2F3 signature heterogeneously, suggesting the\\npresence of occult alterations that phenocopy the effects of E2F3\\nampliﬁcation and/or RB1 inactivation in some E2F3/RB1–wild-type\\nbladder tumors. Expression proﬁling data indicated a strong concor-\\ndance between copy number aberration and expression score for all\\ngenes except RB1 (Data Supplement).\\nBecause RB1 alterations are found in the majority of neuroendo-\\ncrine lung cancers,21 we correlated RB1 and E2F3 alterations with the\\npresence of neuroendocrine histology. Both E2F3 ampliﬁcation and\\nRB1 deletion/mutation were more prevalent in the subset of tumors\\nexhibiting neuroendocrine differentiation compared with those with\\npredominantly urothelial morphology (E2F3, 50% v 17%; P \\x02 .03;\\nRB1, 50% v 13%; P \\x02 .01). Tumors containing neuroendocrine mor-\\nphology also had higher rates of TP53 alterations and a higher CNA\\nburden (Data Supplement).\\nCollectively, our integrated analysis revealed that although blad-\\nder cancers are genetically heterogeneous, subsets of tumors could be\\nidentiﬁed by discrete, nonoverlapping alterations that could serve as\\nthe basis for therapeutic intervention. Notably, 61% of tumors har-\\nbored an actionable alteration (events that, on the basis of clinical or\\npreclinical data, would be predicted to confer sensitivity to selective\\ninhibitors approved for use in other malignancies or currently in\\nclinical testing). To determine whether the genomic heterogeneity of\\nthe human disease could be modeled in preclinical studies, we per-\\nformed a similar integrative analysis on a panel of bladder cancer cell\\nlines.Wefoundonlyamodestoverlapbetweenthegenomicproﬁleof\\nthe tumor and cell line cohorts. For example, none of the bladder\\ncancer cell lines had focal ampliﬁcation of the ERBB2 gene. Neverthe-\\nless, several potentially actionable alterations were observed in both\\nthe tumor and cell line panels. In particular, aberrations in genes\\nwithinthePI3K/AKTsignalingpathwaywerehighlyprevalentinboth\\n(Fig 4A; Data Supplement).\\nToexplorethefunctionalsigniﬁcanceofPI3K/AKTalterationsin\\nbladder cancer, we assessed the AKT dependence of a subset of the\\nbladdercancercelllinesasafunctionoftheirpathwaymutationstatus\\nby using MK2206, a highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of AKT1,\\nAKT2, and AKT3.

In bladder cancer cells with PIK3CA mutations, treat-\\nment with MK2206 resulted in downregulation of phosphorylated\\nAKT and inhibition of downstream AKT effectors including FOX-01/\\n03,PRAS40,S6,and4EBP(Fig4C).TreatmentofTSC-1–nullbladder\\ncancer cells with MK2206 similarly resulted in potent inhibition of\\nAKT activation and proximal AKT effectors, including phospho–\\nFOX-01/03 and phospho-PRAS40, but in contrast to the effects of\\nAKT inhibition in PIK3CA-mutant cells, a signiﬁcant reduction in\\nphosphorylated S6 and 4EBP1 expression was not observed.\\nTherefore, although PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin\\n(mTOR) pathway mutations are common in bladder cancer, the\\nsensitivity of bladder tumors to selective inhibitors of this pathway\\nwill be dictated by the underlying genetic determinant of path-\\nway activation.\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis integrative genomic analysis was performed to deﬁne the preva-\\nlence and co-occurrence of actionable drug targets in patients with\\nhigh-grade bladder cancer.

This result is consistent with prior\\nstudies showing that TP53 and RB1 inactivation induces genomic\\ninstability and promotes aneuploidy.27,28 Although not clinically\\ndistinct, the strong correlation between the degree of structural\\naberration and TP53 and RB1 mutation status suggests that these\\nevents play a central role in the pathogenesis of high-burden CNA\\nbladder cancers.\\nBecause functional studies using human cancer cell lines have\\nhistorically served as the basis for the clinical development of novel\\ncancer therapies, we compared the genomic proﬁle of the high-grade\\nbladder cancers to a collection of bladder cancer cell lines commonly\\nused in preclinical studies. We found only a modest overlap between\\nthe genomic proﬁles of the tumors and cell lines with some potential\\ndrug targets, such as ERBB2 ampliﬁcation, not represented in the cell\\nlines. These results indicate that a signiﬁcantly larger panel of bladder\\ncancer cell lines will be needed to model the genomic complexity of\\nthis disease. Because genomic alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR\\npathway were common in both, a subset of cell lines was used to\\ndetermine whether mutation status predicted for sensitivity to the\\nselective AKT inhibitor MK2206. Consistent with data from breast\\nand ovarian cancers,24,29 treatment of PIK3CA- and PTEN-mutant\\ncell lines with MK2206 was associated with modulation of AKT, its\\ndownstreameffectors,andcellproliferation.Incontrast,celllineswith\\nmutations in TSC-1, a downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT path-\\nway, were resistant to MK2206 despite potent inhibition of AKT and\\nthe proximal AKT substrates PRAS40 and FOX-01/03.

Sawyers, June 19, 2014 (sent for review May 7, 2014)\\nPrimary prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men\\nbut has highly variable outcomes, highlighting the need for\\nbiomarkers to determine which patients can be managed conser-\\nvatively. Few large prostate oncogenome resources currently exist\\nthat combine the molecular and clinical outcome data necessary to\\ndiscover prognostic biomarkers. Previously, we found an associa-\\ntion between relapse and the pattern of DNA copy number\\nalteration (CNA) in 168 primary tumors, raising the possibility of\\nCNA as a prognostic biomarker. Here we examine this question by\\nprofiling an additional 104 primary prostate cancers and updating\\nthe initial 168 patient cohort with long-term clinical outcome. We\\nfind that CNA burden across the genome, defined as the percent-\\nage of the tumor genome affected by CNA, was associated with\\nbiochemical recurrence and metastasis after surgery in these two\\ncohorts, independent of the prostate-specific antigen biomarker or\\nGleason grade, a major existing histopathological prognostic vari-\\nable in prostate cancer. Moreover, CNA burden was associated\\nwith biochemical recurrence in intermediate-risk Gleason 7 pros-\\ntate cancers, independent of prostate-specific antigen or nomo-\\ngram score. We further demonstrate that CNA burden can be\\nmeasured in diagnostic needle biopsies using low-input whole-\\ngenome sequencing, setting the stage for studies of prognostic\\nimpact in conservatively treated cohorts.\\ngenomics | prognosis | oncology\\nP\\nrostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and\\nthe most common malignancy in men. Given the slow growth\\nrate and low metastatic potential of many primary prostate cancers\\n(1), it is critical to identify those men who can be managed con-\\nservatively through active surveillance versus those who need ag-\\ngressive therapy at time of first diagnosis (2, 3). Today, these\\ntreatment decisions are primarily made on the basis of tumor\\nstage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and the histopath-\\nological measure of tumor cell differentiation, the Gleason score.\\nThese three factors, together with additional pathological varia-\\nbles assessed in the prostatectomy sample, such as lymph node\\ninvolvement, are often used to estimate risk of relapse with ac-\\ncuracies in the 70–80% range (3). Postoperative nomograms that\\nincorporate these variables have been developed using large\\ncohorts of typically >1,000 patients and consistently show greater\\naccuracy than preoperative nomograms, where pathological vari-\\nables are limited to those than can be gleaned from biopsies (4).\\nWith increasing interest in active surveillance, however, it is crit-\\nical to improve risk prediction in the preoperative setting (5, 6).\\nToward this end, many groups have investigated molecular\\nand genetic alterations present in tumors that correlate with out-\\ncome (3). Tumor-derived RNA signatures have been developed\\nthat are associated with the risk of death from prostate cancer, some\\nof which are now in clinical use (7–9). These molecular signatures\\nwere generally developed from tumor samples obtained at surgery\\nby examining their association with outcome after surgery, then\\nsubsequently evaluated in the preoperative setting using biopsies as\\nthe source of tumor RNA. Whereas the clinical application of DNA\\nsignatures has lagged behind that of RNA-based signatures, DNA\\nalterations have the potential to serve as orthogonal prognostic\\nmarkers that are robust to degradation and other technical limi-\\ntations of RNA-based assays (10, 11).\\nThe discovery of prognostic genomic markers relies heavily on\\nprostate cancer cohorts that have both complete genomic and\\nclinical outcome annotation, but few such cohorts exist (12, 13).\\nWe previously reported a cohort of 168 primary cases that\\ncombined full clinical annotation with extensive gene expression\\nand copy number profiling of the tumor at surgery (14). This\\ncohort serves as a broadly used resource for biological and bio-\\nmarker discovery (7, 8, 15–18). In this initial cohort, we found\\nthat the pattern of DNA copy number alteration (CNA) in prostate\\ntumors at prostatectomy was associated with biochemical re-\\ncurrence (BCR) (2). CNAs have also been found at high preva-\\nlence in cell-free serum DNA of prostate cancer patients (10).\\nHere we update the clinical outcome data from that initial cohort,\\nwhich now includes a sufficient number of cases with metastasis as\\na definitive clinical endpoint. We have also developed a second,\\nindependent cohort of 104 primary prostate cancers with long-term\\nclinical follow-up and profiled these for CNA, providing an in-\\ndependent cohort for prognostic discovery and validation.\\nSignificance\\nProstate cancer is a major health burden with significant over-\\ntreatment because of difficulty segregating high- and low-risk\\ndisease. Discovery of biomarkers that stratify risk could have\\na broad public health impact but requires cohorts with com-\\nprehensive molecular and clinical follow-up. We characterize\\ntwo independent prostate cancer cohorts with genomic and\\nclinical data that include biochemical recurrence and metastasis.\\nWe demonstrate that copy number alteration (CNA) burden,\\na measure of the fraction of a tumor genome that is copy\\nnumber altered, is prognostic for recurrence and metastasis. CNA\\nburden is also associated with cancer recurrence in an in-\\ntermediate risk population, and can be identified in biopsies.\\nThis work provides a clinicogenomic resource and highlights\\noncogenomics’ potential to identify needed prognostic factors.\\nAuthor contributions: H.H., N.S., A.G., B.S.C., P.T.S., B.S.T., and C.L.S. designed research;\\nH.H., N.S., A.G., M.T.C., Y.X., A.H., K.H., M.B., R.M., V.R., and B.S.T. performed research;\\nH.H., N.S., C.S., V.R., and B.S.T. contributed new reagents/analytic tools; H.H., N.S., A.G.,\\nB.S.C., M.T.C., M.A., R.M., A.V., P.T.S., V.R., B.S.T., and C.L.S. analyzed data; and H.H., M.A.,\\nA.V., P.T.S., B.S.T., and C.L.S. wrote the paper.\\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\\nData deposition: The data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Ex-\\npression Omnibus (GEO) database, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo (accession no.

To generate an independent cohort of\\nprostate cancer patients with molecular and clinical follow-up\\ndata, we analyzed genome-wide CNAs in 104 prostatectomy\\ncases from Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center. This co-\\nhort, hereafter referred to as the contemporary cohort, had\\na median follow-up time of 6 y (Table S1 and Dataset S1). We\\nalso updated the full clinical and outcome information from our\\ninitial cohort (14) of 181 prostatectomy cases (Datasets S2–S4),\\nincluding 168 cases with high-resolution CNA data (Dataset S2)\\nand a median follow-up of 8 y (Table S1). This initial cohort has\\nserved as a widely used prostate cancer resource with copy\\nnumber, gene expression, and clinical and outcome annotation\\n(7, 15–20); it now includes metastasis as a definitive clinical\\nendpoint in a significant number of cases. The initial and con-\\ntemporary cohorts have BCR incidence rates of 43 and 53 per\\n1,000 person-years and metastasis incidence rates of 15 and 5 per\\n1,000 person-years, respectively. These cohorts have BCR rates\\nof 27% (n = 46) and 23% (n = 24), respectively, and metastasis\\nrates of 11 (n = 19) and 3% (n = 3), respectively, representing\\none of few large prostate oncogenomic resources with substantial\\noutcome data.\\nThe clinical characteristics of the two independent prostate\\ncancer cohorts are similar (Fig. S1 and Table S1). Pretreatment\\nPSA, age, and lymph node and seminal vesicle invasion did not\\nsignificantly differ between cohorts (Table S1). The rate of\\nextracapsular extension was higher in the contemporary cohort\\n(Table S1) (P value = 0.05) whereas positive surgical margins\\nwere more prevalent in the initial cohort (Table S1) (P value =\\n0.04). The Gleason score distribution differed between the two\\ncohorts (P value = 0.022), with the contemporary cohort having\\na higher percentage of Gleason 7 cases and the initial cohort\\nhaving a higher percentage of Gleason 6 and 8 cases. Nonethe-\\nless, these clinical differences did not translate into outcome risk\\ndifferences. The two cohorts were not significantly different in\\ntheir risk of BCR, determined by the Stephenson postoperative\\nnomogram (21), which combines clinical and pathological vari-\\nables such as age, PSA, Gleason grade, and pathological stage\\n(Fig. S1 and Table S1) (P value = 0.8).\\nThe landscape of CNAs observed in the contemporary cohort\\nis highly representative of the gross pattern of aberrations in\\nprostate cancer genomes, including in our initial cohort, that of\\nBarbieri et al. (22), and the interim Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\\nprostate cancer cohort (Fig. 1A); these include frequent genomic\\nlosses on chromosomes 6p, 8p, 13q, and 16p, genomic gains of 7\\nand 8q, and established focal alterations spanning phosphatase\\nand tensin homolog (PTEN), RB1, and tumor protein p53\\n(TP53) among others (Fig. 1B). The level of CNAs in the new\\ncohort was lower on average than earlier cohorts (Fig. 1), pos-\\nsibly reflecting differences in cohort selection criteria. None-\\ntheless, the contemporary cohort possesses canonical alterations\\ncommon to prostate cancer.\\nGenome-Wide CNA Is Prognostic for Prostate Cancer Recurrence and\\nMetastasis. In our initial prostate cancer cohort, some CNA\\npatterns identified by hierarchical clustering were previously\\nfound to be correlated with the risk of BCR (14). Clinical ap-\\nplication of this finding, however, is complicated by the analytical\\nchallenge of assigning individual patients to a risk group based\\non a clustering analysis derived from a different population.\\nWe therefore asked whether CNA burden, a simple metric of\\nCNA level defined as the percent of the autosomal tumor ge-\\nnome bearing CNAs, could be used as an informative measure of\\nCNA. CNA burden represents the level of copy number gains\\nand losses across the genome in a tumor. To calculate CNA\\nburden for a sample, segments of copy number gains and losses\\nwere determined (23), and their total genomic length was sum-\\nmed and calculated as a percentage of the size of the autosomal\\ngenome. In primary prostate cancer genomes, CNA burden\\nranged from less than 0.1% to greater than 50%, with an average\\nof 5% and 4% for the initial and contemporary cohorts, re-\\nspectively. This finding differs significantly from the higher CNA\\nburden of metastatic prostate cancers (∼32%), as well as of other\\nurogenital neoplasms, such as bladder and renal cell carcinomas\\n(Fig. 1C).\\nCNA burden, when examined as a continuous variable, was\\nsignificantly associated with BCR in both the initial and con-\\ntemporary cohorts [hazard ratios (HR) = 1.09 and 1.05, re-\\nspectively, for each percent change in CNA burden; P values ≤\\n0.0001 and 0.008, respectively] (Table 1). We additionally sought\\nto determine whether CNA burden was associated with BCR\\nwhen patients were separated into groups based on discrete\\nlevels of CNA in their tumor genomes. As a starting point for this\\nanalysis, we examined the CNA burden from our earlier hierar-\\nchical clustering analysis, which segregated tumors into groups\\nwith low, intermediate, and high CNA burdens, independent of\\nclinical outcome (14). We reasoned that the mean CNA burden\\nin the low and intermediate alteration clusters (1.34% and 5.41%,\\nrespectively) would serve as logical thresholds for further stratified\\nanalysis. These thresholds are not based on risk categories from the\\nprior group, but rather copy number clusters indicative of the\\nBarbieri et al.\\nInitial cohort\\n(Taylor et al.)\\nContemporary\\ncohort\\nTCGA (provisional)\\nq<10 -7\\n0\\n-0.25\\n0.25\\n6p\\n8p\\n8q\\n13q\\n16q\\n7\\nPTEN\\nRB1\\nTP53\\nt\\nr\\no\\nh\\no\\nc\\nl\\na\\ni\\nt\\ni\\nn\\nI\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nRenal (clear cell)\\nRenal (papillary cell)\\nProstate (metastases)\\nBladder (urothelial)\\nProstate (primaries)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nCNA burden\\nContemporary\\nLoss\\nGain\\nCopy number (log2)\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n21\\nFig. 1.\\nCopy number landscape of primary prostate cancer.

Stratification at the intermediate CNA\\nburden threshold (5.41% CNA) was associated with BCR in both\\nthe initial and contemporary cohorts, with HRs of 1.99 and 3.85,\\nrespectively (P values = 0.021 and 0.001) (Fig. 2 A and B and Table\\n1). Similarly, this finding holds true for patients stratified by low\\nCNA burden threshold (1.34% CNA) with HRs of 2.03 and 2.42\\nfor the initial and contemporary cohorts, respectively (P values =\\n0.048 and 0.037, respectively) (Fig. S2). Patients in the initial co-\\nhort, with a low CNA burden (<1.34% CNA), had a 13% risk of\\nrecurrence within 5 y, compared with a 29% risk of BCR for those\\nwith a higher CNA burden (≥1.34% CNA) estimated by Kaplan–\\nMeier. Similarly, patients in the contemporary cohort with a low\\nCNA burden had a 15% risk of BCR, compared with a 38% risk\\nfor those with a higher CNA burden (≥1.34% CNA). If cases were\\ndichotomized on the basis of their cohort’s CNA burden quartiles\\nrather than the independently defined CNA cluster medians, CNA\\nburden is still significantly associated with BCR in both cohorts and\\nwith metastasis in the initial cohort (insufficient metastatic events\\nin the contemporary cohort) by Cox proportional hazards re-\\ngression (Table S2). For groups with CNA burden above and\\nbelow the 75th percentile of their cohort, for example, CNA\\nburden is associated with BCR with HRs of 2.65 and 4.43, re-\\nspectively, for the initial and validation cohorts (P values = 0.001\\nand < 0.001) (Fig. S3 and Table S2).\\nThe longer clinical follow-up now available for the initial cohort\\nallowed us to analyze—to our knowledge for the first time—the\\nassociation between CNA burden and metastasis as a definitive\\nendpoint (Fig. 2C and Table 1). CNA burden was significantly\\nassociated with metastasis in the initial cohort as a continuous\\nvariable in a univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model\\n(HR = 1.10; P value = 0.0004) (Table 1) and neared significance\\nas a stratified variable (Cox proportional hazards regression\\nP value = 0.0524, Mantel–Cox log-rank P value = 0.044) (Table 1\\nand Fig. 2C). Because of the shorter available follow-up time,\\nthe contemporary cohort possessed too few metastatic events (n = 3)\\nfor this analysis.\\nCNA Burden Is Associated with Recurrence in Multivariate Clinical\\nModels. We next assessed whether CNA burden was prognostic\\nin multivariate models when combined with established clinical\\nvariables, such as Gleason score and nomogram score. Gleason\\nscore, together with PSA level and clinical stage, is used in the\\npreoperative setting to guide whether to treat or conservatively\\nmonitor an individual. CNA burden was significantly associated\\nwith BCR in both cohorts when corrected for pretreatment PSA\\n(HR = 1.09 and 1.04 for each percent change in CNA burden,\\nrespectively, for initial and contemporary cohorts; P values <\\n0.001 and 0.025) (Table 2). When adjusted for biopsy Gleason\\nscore in multivariate models, CNA burden also remained asso-\\nciated with BCR in both cohorts (HR = 1.08 and 1.05, re-\\nspectively, for initial and contemporary cohorts; P values <\\n0.0001 and 0.026) (Table 2). Moreover, when biopsy Gleason\\nscore categories included separate Gleason 3+4 and 4+3 groups,\\nCNA burden was still associated with BCR in multivariate\\nmodels with both cohorts (HR = 1.09, P value <0.001, for the\\ninitial cohort; HR = 1.05, P value = 0.041, for the contemporary\\ncohort). This result was also true for metastasis in the initial\\ncohort (HR = 1.07, P value = 0.036) where there are sufficient\\nevents for analysis.\\nWe next examined the prognostic significance of CNA burden\\nwhen corrected for postoperative variables, such as pathology\\nGleason score and the Stephenson nomogram. CNA burden was\\nassociated with BCR in both cohorts after correcting for pa-\\nthology Gleason score (HR = 1.04 and 1.05 per 1% change in\\nCNA burden, respectively, for initial and contemporary cohorts;\\nP values = 0.043 and 0.026) (Table 2). In contrast, the post-\\noperative Stephenson nomogram relies on additional post-\\noperative variables, such as extracapsular extension, lymph node\\ninvolvement, surgical margins, and treatment year to assess\\npostoperative recurrence risk (21). Although the addition of\\nCNA burden did not result in an increase in the concordance\\nindex from 0.812 and 0.817 in the initial or contemporary\\ncohorts, respectively, CNA burden was still associated with BCR\\nin the contemporary cohort when combined with the Stephenson\\nTable 1.\\nThe association of CNA burden with the risk of BCR and metastasis\\nEvent\\nVariable\\nInitial cohort*\\nContemporary cohort†\\nP\\nHR\\n95% CI\\nP\\nHR\\n95% CI\\nBCR\\nCNA burden‡\\n<0.001\\n1.09\\n1.06\\n1.13\\n0.008\\n1.05\\n1.01\\n1.09\\nBCR\\nStratified CNA burden§\\n0.021\\n1.99\\n1.11\\n3.55\\n0.001\\n3.86\\n1.73\\n8.64\\nMetastasis\\nCNA burden‡\\n<0.001\\n1.10\\n1.04\\n1.15\\ninsufficient events\\nMetastasis\\nStratified CNA burden§\\n0.052\\n2.47\\n0.99\\n6.15\\ninsufficient events\\n*Initial cohort total n = 168, BCR n = 46 (43 per 1,000 person-years), metastases n = 19 (15 per 1,000 person-years).\\n†Contemporary cohort n = 104, BCR n = 24 (53 per 1,000 person-years), metastases n = 3 (5 per 1,000\\nperson-years).\\n‡Per 1% change in CNA burden (continuous).\\n§The reference category is CNA burden ≤5.41% (mean of intermediate CNA clusters).\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nFig. 2.\\nCNA burden in prostate cancer genomes is associated with recurrence and metastasis.

We found a wide range\\nof CNA burden across Gleason 7 cancers in both cohorts with\\nranges of 0.05–25% in the initial cohort and 0.003–50% in the\\ncontemporary cohort (Fig. S4). In Gleason 7 tumors, we found\\nthat CNA burden was significantly associated with BCR in both\\nthe initial and contemporary cohorts (HR = 1.08 and 1.06, re-\\nspectively; P values = 0.011 and 0.017, respectively) (Fig. 3 and\\nTable 3). CNA burden remained significantly associated with\\nBCR in Gleason 7 disease after correcting for pretreatment\\nPSA in the initial and contemporary cohorts (P values = 0.006\\nand 0.019, respectively) (Table 3). Moreover, CNA burden was\\nassociated with BCR after adjusting for the Stephenson 5-y no-\\nmogram in the contemporary cohort (P value = 0.014) (Table 3)\\nand approached significance in the initial cohort (P value = 0.062)\\n(Table 3), although it did not improve the concordance index\\nabove 0.7 achieved with the nomogram alone. Too few metas-\\ntases were available in the Gleason 7 subpopulation for analysis.\\nCNA Burden Provides Prognostic Information Beyond RNA-Based\\nSignature and Can Be Established in Tumor Biopsies. Recent work\\nhas established the prognostic significance of gene expression-\\nbased signatures in prostate cancers, including a cell cycle pro-\\ngression (CCP) signature recently developed for clinical use (8).\\nWe compared a nonproprietary version of the RNA-based CCP\\nsignature to the DNA-based CNA burden within our initial cohort,\\nfor which both DNA copy number and RNA expression data had\\nbeen generated. Both the CCP signature and CNA burden were\\nindependently associated with BCR, with HRs of 1.124 and 1.097,\\nrespectively (P value = 0.05 and <0.001, initial cohort cases with\\nboth expression and CNA data, n = 113) (Table S3).

The pattern\\nand extent of CNAs identified were consistent between aCGH and\\nwhole-genome sequencing in even the challenging low-input FFPE\\nDNA setting, spanning from concordant focal deletions (3p13\\nspanning FOXP1, RYBP, and SHQ1) to arm-level gains and losses\\nof significance to prostate cancer biology (7, 8p, 8q, and 13q). In\\naddition to concordance among discrete CNAs, the amplitudes—\\nand therefore their clonal representation—was also highly consis-\\ntent (Fig. 4). These results illustrate that whole-genome sequencing\\ncan achieve copy number profiling comparable to aCGH and ena-\\nbles characterization of lower tumor burden FFPE biopsies.\\n'), Document(page_content='Discussion\\nProstate cancer has seen an increase in intermediate and early-\\nstage disease at diagnosis, with widespread use of PSA to screen\\nfor prostate cancer and an increase in the number of needle\\ncores taken during biopsy (3). Although Gleason score and other\\nclinicopathologic variables are used to guide treatment decisions,\\ncurrent approaches often do not sufficiently discriminate be-\\ntween those patients who would likely benefit from immediate\\ntreatment and those whose treatment can be delayed or avoided\\ncompletely while their cancer is monitored (25). Recent clinical\\ntrials have suggested that 15 patients must be treated to prevent\\none prostate cancer death overall, and patients under 65 expe-\\nrience a more substantial treatment benefit (26). The challenge\\nfaced by physicians and patients with this common cancer is to\\nfind better ways to characterize the risk posed by each cancer so\\nthat more appropriate treatment decisions can be made. Addi-\\ntional prognostic factors are, therefore, urgently needed to identify\\ncancers unlikely to progress, especially among the intermediate-\\nrisk population.\\nThe discovery of molecular biomarkers for prostate cancer has\\nbeen hindered by the paucity of molecular subtypes with distinct\\noutcomes. Part of the difficulty stems from the long natural\\nhistory of prostate cancer and its low rate of progression. As\\na result, whereas many comprehensive genomic studies have\\ndefined alterations in prostate cancer genomes, none have had\\nsufficient clinical and outcome annotation to generate prognostic\\nadvances. We have collected the clinically annotated cohorts\\npresented here to help address these challenges. The initial co-\\nhort has been used extensively by others for prognostic discovery\\nand validation (7, 8, 27) and is updated here by providing a de-\\nfinitive clinical endpoint, metastasis, in significant numbers. The\\nadditional independent contemporary cohort now provides a\\nresource for validation of CNA as a prognostic factor and\\nother associations. Because many patients with BCR after sur-\\ngery will not develop metastases (28), it is important to test\\nprognostic biomarkers with unequivocal clinical endpoints, such\\na metastases or death. Few associations between genetic alter-\\nations and metastasis have been studied in large patient cohorts,\\nand this work may enable their discovery.\\nWe have shown that CNA burden, as a global measure of the\\nlevel of CNA across tumor genomes, is associated with BCR over\\na broad spectrum of clinical presentations and adds additional\\ninformation to currently available clinicopathological variables.\\nCNA burden is also associated with the definitive endpoint of\\nmetastasis. Moreover, CNA burden is significantly associated\\nwith BCR in intermediate risk Gleason 7 patients, raising the\\npossibility of better stratifying this intermediate risk population.\\nCNA burden varies significantly in other cancers, with many\\nshowing large ranges in CNA burden across their populations. It\\nmay therefore be fruitful to also explore the prognostic signifi-\\ncance of CNA burden in other cancers as well.\\nAs we have shown that CNA burden can be successfully de-\\ntermined in formalin-fixed needle biopsies, future work may\\nexplore CNA burden within large biopsy cohorts to determine its\\nprognostic power (29, 30). The fact that CNA burden adds to the\\nimpact of existing cell cycle RNA markers provides further\\nmotivation for a biopsy cohort study (7, 9). It will be important to\\nknow if CNA burden in biopsy samples of low- and intermediate-\\nrisk patients will be useful in making the decision for immediate\\ntherapy or active surveillance. Active surveillance cohorts may be\\na particularly useful resource to reduce the effect of treatment\\non the ability to determine the prognostic association between\\nCNA burden and outcome.\\nTable 3.\\nCNA burden is associated with prostate cancer recurrence in Gleason 7 cases\\nEvent\\nVariable\\nInitial cohort (n = 168)\\nContemporary cohort (n = 104)\\nP\\nHR\\n95% CI\\nP\\nHR\\n95% CI\\nUnivariate Cox regression\\nBCR\\nCNA burden\\n0.011\\n1.08\\n1.02\\n1.14\\n0.017\\n1.06\\n1.01\\n1.11\\nMultivariable Cox regression\\nBCR\\nCNA burden\\n0.006\\n1.08\\n1.02\\n1.15\\n0.019\\n1.06\\n1.01\\n1.11\\nPretreatment PSA\\n0.001\\n1.00\\n1.00\\n1.01\\n0.912\\n1.00\\n0.94\\n1.07\\nBCR\\nCNA burden\\n0.062\\n1.06\\n1.00\\n1.12\\n0.014\\n1.06\\n1.01\\n1.12\\nStephenson nomogram\\n0.002\\n0.03\\n<0.01\\n0.29\\n0.001\\n0.01\\n<0.01\\n0.17\\n1                 3               5           7          9        11       13     15    17  19  21\\n2               4             6           8         10       12      14    16   18  20 22\\ncase 1\\naCGH\\n100ng WGS\\n250ng WGS\\ncase 2\\ncase 3\\ncase 4\\n13q\\n7p/q\\n6q\\n8p 8q\\n3p13\\naCGH\\n100ng WGS\\n250ng WGS\\naCGH\\n100ng WGS\\n250ng WGS\\naCGH\\n100ng WGS\\n250ng WGS\\nFig. 4.\\nCNA burden can be established in the diagnostic setting using\\nFFPE needle biopsies.

A total of 104 tumor and\\nmatched normal samples were obtained from patients treated by prosta-\\ntectomy at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center with Institutional\\nReview Board approval. BCR was defined as an increase in PSA of ≥0.2 ng/mL\\non two occasions. The 2005 Stephenson nomogram for postoperative risk of\\nBCR at 5 y was reported (21). Patient follow-up data were updated through\\nMarch 2013.\\naCGH. Snap-frozen samples containing greater than 70% tumor cell content\\nwere dissected from their frozen blocks. Tumor and pooled reference\\n(Promega) DNA was extracted, labeled, and analyzed by aCGH. Agilent\\n1M feature arrays were used for the contemporary cohort and the 244K\\narrays for biopsy cases.\\nWhole-Genome Sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing libraries were pre-\\npared using 100-ng or 250-ng input FFPE biopsy dsDNA (picogreen) from four\\npatients. Paired-end 100-bp libraries were generated (KAPA LTP kit, Kappa\\nBiosystems) and sequenced by HiSEq. 2000.\\nDNA CNA. For aCGH data, all copy-number array data from patients in the\\ncontemporary cohort were quantified, normalized, segmented, and analyzed\\nwith RAE, as previously described (14). To assess the percent of autosomal\\ngenome affected by CNA in both the initial and contemporary cohorts, the\\nper-tumor parameterization by RAE was used (23). For the analyses de-\\nscribed here, CNAs are those segments whose value of A0 or D0 (gains and\\nlosses or more, respectively) were greater than or equal to 0.75. The total\\ngenomic territory spanned by these contiguous segments was summed and\\na percent was generated using the size of the autosomal human genome.\\nFor sequencing data, reads were aligned to hg19 of the human genome\\nwith BWA. The aligned first read-in pair was retained and coverage calculated\\nin 100-kb nonoverlapping windows of the autosomal genome. In each ge-\\nnome, a locally weighted polynomial regression was fit between read cov-\\nerage and G+C% content in alignable regions not overlapping known gaps\\nin the reference assembly. G+C%-content normalization using the loess fit\\nto normalize read counts in each independent tumor and matched normal\\ngenome before segmentation. A pseudocount was added to read counts\\ngenome-wide in both samples, the ratio was normalized by library size, and\\nsegmented with circular binary segmentation. Individual samples were then\\nanalyzed with RAE to determine CAN, as described above.\\nStatistical Analyses. For cohort characteristics, P values were determined by\\nWilcoxon rank sum for continuous variables and by Fisher’s exact test for\\ncategorical variables. We tested for a univariate association between CNA\\nand BCR or metastasis in the initial and contemporary cohorts separately.\\nCNA was then added to a multivariable Cox proportional hazards-regression\\nmodel for the risk of BCR. The proportional hazards model was not checked,\\nas formal testing of the proportional hazards assumption is of limited utility;\\nit is known that for outcomes, such as BCR or metastases after treatment,\\nthat the proportional hazards assumption is not met with long follow-up\\ntime. For Kaplan–Meier analyses, follow-up time was censored to 14.5 y and\\nthe Mantel–Cox log-rank significance reported. For outcome analyses per-\\nformed using a stratification of cases on the basis of their CNA burden, we\\ngrouped case cut-points of 5.41% and 1.34%, which represent the mean\\nCNA burden from patient genomes that defined the intermediate and low\\nalteration clusters reported previously (14) (clusters 1, 3, and 4 vs. 2, re-\\nspectively). To assess the discriminative accuracy of the models developed,\\nwe calculated Harrell’s C concordance statistic after 10-fold cross-validation.\\nThe nonproprietary CCP signature score was defined as the average of the\\nexpression level (Affymetrix) of the 30 CCP genes with available expression\\ndata in our cohort.\\nData Access.

Two recent ana-\\nlyses of UK Biobank data address this by focusing on a small\\nnumber of high-risk CH genes and incorporating other hematologic\\nparameters into risk models.17,18 These studies are a signiﬁcant step\\nforward in understanding the risk posed by CH in healthy individuals.\\nMost mutations in hematopoietic cells occur stochastically and are\\nfunctionally neutral.

Variants\\nwere retained if identiﬁed by 2 callers. Postprocessing ﬁlters were\\nused to remove putative sequencing artifacts and germ line poly-\\nmorphisms before data interpretation. Conventional CH variants\\nwere deﬁned as nonsynonymous variants in exons and mutations\\nwith a predicted impact on splicing. Silent CH variants were syn-\\nonymous variants in coding regions and nonsplice site noncoding\\nvariants. Mosaic chromosome alterations were identiﬁed using\\nFACETS-CH, as previously described.25-27\\nStatistical analysis\\nDescriptive analyses and data visualization were performed in R\\nversion 4.1. The day of the blood draw procedure was considered\\nday 0 in all analyses. Statistical models evaluating CH estimated\\nsubdistribution hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of hematologic\\nmalignancy with Fine and Gray competing risk regression using R\\npackage cmprsk. Death was included as a competing risk, and\\nthese models were adjusted for gender, solid cancer type, and age\\nusing a penalized spline. The analysis of gene-speciﬁc hazard rate\\nwas performed using cause-speciﬁc Cox regression with Firth\\npenalized likelihood using R package coxphf.

We considered alterations of\\nchromosomes 5, 7, and 17 (5/7/17) as a separate group because\\nthey are associated with poor prognoses in myeloid neoplasms and\\nare recurrent events in therapy-related myeloid leukemia.

In contrast, most\\npatients who went on to develop therapy-related myeloid neo-\\nplasms (high-risk MDS or acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) as well\\nmost of those who went on to develop high-grade B-cell lym-\\nphomas did not have CH at the time of assessment.

Additionally, consideration\\nof the union of patients with either CH type with at least 1 high VAF\\nmutation expanded the pool of patients at elevated risk (3070\\npatients with a conventional CH VAF > 10% had HR, 2.93\\n[95% CI, 2.01-4.25], whereas the liberalized set of 4204 patients\\nwith either conventional or silent VAF > 10% had HR, 2.83\\n[95% CI, 1.97-4.06]). To conﬁrm that the risks associated with\\nsilent CH are unlikely to be due to unannotated functional variants,\\nwe performed sensitivity analyses examining synonymous coding\\nregion variants and other variants separately. In age-adjusted\\nmodels comparing the binary presence or absence of all silent\\nCH, synonymous coding silent CH, and other silent CH HRs were\\nsimilar (all silent CH: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.23-2.27; synonymous\\ncoding HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.10-2.65; other silent variant HR, 1.48;\\n95% CI, 1.03-.211). In contrast to conventional CH, silent CH was\\nnot strongly associated with mortality in our cohort (supplemental\\nFigure 6). Altogether, these ﬁndings show that that single silent\\nnonprotein coding changes identiﬁed in gene panel sequencing\\nhave predictive signiﬁcance.\\nDetection of CH mutations in subsequent\\nhematologic malignancies\\nCH variants predating the diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy\\ncould be present in clones that are disease precursors or disease\\nbystanders. In the former case, the observed VAF is likely to\\nincrease at the manifestation of clinical disease. We looked for\\nevidence of clonal expansion in hematologic malignancy cases\\nsequenced with MSK IMPACT that arose in patients in which at\\nleast 1 CH variant was identiﬁed. 84 variants in 26 cases were\\nidentiﬁed. Variants in 6 genes (ASXL1, CHEK2, DNMT3A, JAK2,\\nTET2, and TP53) were observed at least three times. We visualized\\nthe clonal trajectory of each recurrent variant from CH assessment\\nto disease (Figure 6). All six JAK2 variants and all four TP53 vari-\\nants increased in size consistent with a disease-deterministic role\\nof these variants. In contrast, only 2 of 7 DNMT3A variants had a\\nhigher VAF at disease diagnosis than at CH assessment arguing\\nagainst a universal constitutional role in disease.\\nWe next divided the full variant set based on disease category and\\nconventional vs silent CH type (supplemental Figure 7). Of the half\\nof all CH variants with VAF > 0.1, 27 of these 42 (64.3%) were\\nlarger at time of disease assessment, whereas only 14 of 42\\n(33.3%) expanded when CH VAF was less than 0.1. Additionally, a\\ngreater fraction of conventional CH mutations (33 of 60; 55%)\\nexpanded than silent CH mutations (8 of 24; 33%). However, silent\\nvariants with VAF > 0.1 expanded in 7 of 12 cases (58.3%),\\n16\\nLog2 (hematologic malignany hazard ratio)\\n4\\n2\\n16\\nLog2 (# non-synonymous mutations/expected)\\n128\\n1024\\n1\\nJAK1\\nXPO1\\nRUNX1\\nCALR\\nJAK2\\nTP53\\nRAD21\\nDNMT3A\\nPPM1D\\nASXL1\\nTET2\\n= –0.09\\nW\\nSUZ12\\nFLT3\\nCHEK2\\nFigure 4.

We found that mutations in JAK2 were strongly asso-\\nciated with subsequent MPN, RUNX1 mutations with subsequent\\ntherapy-related myeloid neoplasms (MDS/AML), and XPO1 muta-\\ntions with subsequent chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Despite\\ndisparate patient populations and detection methods, our ﬁndings\\nare consistent with a recent study in healthy subjects similarly\\nfocusing\\nattention\\non\\na\\nsmaller\\nnumber\\nof\\nhigh-risk\\nCH\\nmutations.17\\nImportantly, we failed to observe strong associations between\\nseveral canonical myeloid driver genes and hematologic malig-\\nnancy. DNMT3A mutations were poor predictors of hematologic\\nmalignancy despite substantial statistical power. In contrast, failure\\nto implicate FLT3 and NPM1 as being associated with a high risk\\nof myeloid leukemia was likely because they are associated with\\nrapid onset of disease making the time window during which they\\nare detectable as CH short. Although rare, CH characterized by\\npathogenic mutations in these genes deserves close attention.\\nIn our cohort, silent CH variants were associated with a modest but\\nsigniﬁcant risk of hematologic malignancy. Most of these mutations\\nare not expected to affect cellular ﬁtness; thus, silent CH is likely a\\nmarker of something else that increases the risk of hematologic\\nmalignancy. Either of 2 likely scenarios could be responsible: (1)\\nthe neutral mutations are passengers associated with hematopoi-\\netic clones with a causal role in disease or (2) the detection of any\\nCH indicates a state of low clonal diversity predisposed to foster\\nother malignant clones.\\nOur study has important limitations. First, it was carried out exclu-\\nsively in patients with nonhematologic cancer. Most patients\\nreceived\\nanticancer\\ntherapy,\\nand\\nmany\\nreceived\\ntraditional\\ncytotoxic chemotherapy. The signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings in people\\nwho do not have cancer is uncertain. Second, the median follow-up\\nduration was limited, in large part because of nonhematologic\\ncancer–related\\nmortality.\\nTherapy-related\\nhematologic\\nmalig-\\nnancies that progress over longer time scales were probably not\\nwell captured. We anticipate that as additional large-scale studies\\nexpand the genomic and clinical data available that we will learn\\nthat many factors contribute to clonal evolution and disease pro-\\ngression in addition to mutations in known CH-driver genes.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by grants from the Edward P.

However, up to 30% of patients with ad-\\nvanced GCT exhibit cisplatin resistance, which requires intensive salvage treatment, and have\\na 50% risk of cancer-related death. To identify a genetic basis for cisplatin resistance, we performed\\nwhole-exome and targeted sequencing of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant GCTs.\\nMethods\\nMen with GCT who received a cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen and had available tumor\\ntissue were eligible to participate in this study. Whole-exome sequencing or targeted exon-\\ncapture–based sequencing was performed on 180 tumors. Patients were categorized as cisplatin\\nsensitive or cisplatin resistant by using a combination of postchemotherapy parameters, including\\nserum tumor marker levels, radiology, and pathology at surgical resection of residual disease.\\n"), Document(page_content="Results\\nTP53 alterations were present exclusively in cisplatin-resistant tumors and were particularly\\nprevalent among primary mediastinal nonseminomas (72%). TP53 pathway alterations including\\nMDM2 ampliﬁcations were more common among patients with adverse clinical features, cate-\\ngorized as poor risk according to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG)\\nmodel. Despite this association, TP53 and MDM2 alterations predicted adverse prognosis in-\\ndependent of the IGCCCG model. Actionable alterations, including novel RAC1 mutations, were\\ndetected in 55% of cisplatin-resistant GCTs.\\nConclusion\\nIn GCT, TP53 and MDM2 alterations were associated with cisplatin resistance and inferior out-\\ncomes, independent of the IGCCCG model. The ﬁnding of frequent TP53 alterations among me-\\ndiastinal primary nonseminomas may explain the more frequent chemoresistance observed with\\nthis tumor subtype.

Prior investigations have yielded conﬂicting results\\nregarding the association of genomic alterations with cisplatin\\nresistance in GCT.3,4 In addition, the utility of prior studies was\\nlimited by small patient populations, the inclusion of few patients\\nwith cisplatin-resistant disease, and/or the lack of comprehensive\\nsequencing approaches.\\nWith the goal of identifying recurrent genetic alterations as-\\nsociated with cisplatin resistance in GCT, we performed whole-\\nexome sequencing (WES) on a discovery cohort of 19 tumors and\\nvalidated our ﬁndings using selective exon-capture sequencing of an\\nadditional 161 GCTs enriched for the cisplatin-resistant phenotype.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nPatient Eligibility\\nThis study was conducted following institutional review board ap-\\nproval. All specimens were obtained from patients evaluated at Memorial\\nSloan Kettering Cancer Center. Men who received standard ﬁrst-line\\ncisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced GCT of any primary site\\nwere eligible if they provided informed consent for tumor molecular\\ncharacterization and had available histologically conﬁrmed fresh or ar-\\nchived tumor tissue containing viable GCT and matching normal DNA.\\nPure teratoma and pure malignant transformation tumors were excluded.\\nStandard ﬁrst-line chemotherapy consisted of at least three cycles of\\na cisplatin-based combination regimen, typically etoposide plus cisplatin\\n(EP), bleomycin plus EP (BEP), or ifosfamide plus EP. First-line treatment\\nwith paclitaxel plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin as part of a phase II clinical\\ntrial (NCT01873326) was also allowed. Patients who received only ad-\\njuvant chemotherapy, carboplatin-based regimens, or fewer than three\\ncycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy were ineligible. Nonprogressing\\npatients were required to have at least 1 year of clinical follow-up.\\nDefinitions of Response and Cisplatin Sensitivity and\\nResistance\\nA complete response (CR) to ﬁrst-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy\\n(CR chemo) was deﬁned as tumor marker normalization and either\\ncomplete resolution of all radiographic evidence of tumor masses or\\ncomplete surgical resection of residual tumor masses revealing necrosis\\nand/or teratoma. When complete surgical resection revealed viable\\nnonteratomatous GCTelements, it was termed a CR to chemotherapy plus\\nsurgery (CR chemo + surgery). Patients who achieved marker normali-\\nzation but did not undergo complete surgical resection of residual disease\\nwere considered to have achieved a partial response with negative tumor\\nmarkers (PR-negative markers). If such patients underwent partial tumor\\nresection, the pathology could consist of only teratoma or necrosis but no\\nviable GCT elements. All other patients were categorized as having an\\nincomplete response (IR).\\nCisplatin resistance has a more stringent deﬁnition in GCT than other\\nadult solid tumors. In this study, patients with cisplatin resistance had to\\nmeet one of the following criteria: (1) IR to ﬁrst-line cisplatin-based\\nchemotherapy, (2) nonteratomatous tumor progression after ﬁrst-line\\ncisplatin-based chemotherapy, or (3) viable nonteratomatous GCT\\nidentiﬁed at postchemotherapy surgery. All other patients were considered\\ncisplatin-sensitive.\\nNext-Generation Sequencing\\nHigh-quality, fresh-frozen tumor tissues were selected for WES\\nanalysis from a discovery cohort consisting of 19 specimens. Representative\\nhematoxylin-and-eosin–stained sections were reviewed by a Memorial\\nSloan Kettering Cancer Center genitourinary pathologist and were con-\\nﬁrmed to have . 40% tumor purity. Additional details regarding the WES\\nspecimens and sequencing are provided in the methods section of the\\nAppendix (online only).\\nTargeted, capture-based, next-generation sequencing of more than\\n300 cancer-related genes to a mean depth of 500- to 1,000-fold coverage\\nwas performed using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation\\nProﬁling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay. MSK-\\nIMPACT was performed on the 19 WES tumors to conﬁrm alterations\\nidentiﬁed by WES and to improve the sensitivity in detecting known\\ncancer-associated genetic alterations.5 MSK-IMPACT was also performed\\non tumors from a prospective validation cohort that comprised 161 ad-\\nditional patients with advanced GCT. Following DNA extraction from\\ntumor- and patient-matched normal samples, barcoded libraries were\\ncaptured, sequenced, and analyzed through a customized pipeline for\\nsomatic mutation calling, copy number alterations, and structural rear-\\nrangements, as previously described.3\\nFunctional Assays\\nDetails of the methods used to functionally characterize RAC1\\nmutations are provided in the Appendix (online only).\\nStatistical "), Document(page_content="Analysis\\nWe assessed the association between alterations and clinicopathologic\\nfeatures (ie, histology, primary site, IGCCCG risk group, sample location)\\nusing Fisher’s exact test. Genes enriched in cisplatin-resistant versus\\ncisplatin-sensitive tumors in the discovery cohort were examined for\\nassociation with cisplatin-sensitivity in the validation cohort. Given the\\nrelative paucity of recurrent mutations, the entire cohort (discovery plus\\nvalidation; N = 180) was used to assess for associations between genetic\\nalterations and clinicopathologic features.\\nAll clinical data were collected through retrospective chart review.\\nProgression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from start date of che-\\nmotherapy to date of progression or death. Cox regression was used to\\nevaluate multivariable associations with PFS.\\nRESULTS\\nTable 1 depicts patient and tumor characteristics for the combined\\ncohort (N = 180), including the 19-sample discovery set and the\\n161-sample validation set. In the discovery cohort, nine tumors\\nwere cisplatin sensitive and 10 were resistant. Of the resistant\\ntumors, eight were metastatic lesions and eight were collected after\\nadministration of chemotherapy.

All mutational and clinical data are available on the cBio\\nCancer Genomics Portal.14\\nDISCUSSION\\nTo our knowledge, ours is the largest series reported to date of\\nadvanced GCT analyzed with massively parallel next generation\\nsequencing. We identiﬁed TP53 pathway alterations among a sig-\\nniﬁcant proportion of patients with cisplatin-resistant disease. In\\nparticular, TP53 alterations were present exclusively in patients\\nwith cisplatin-resistant tumors (Figs 2A and 2B). In addition, as\\none might expect for a biomarker of adverse outcome, mutually\\nexclusive TP53/MDM2 alterations were signiﬁcantly more frequent\\namong patients with unfavorable clinical characteristics, such as\\ncategorization in the IGCCCG poor-risk group and having\\na mediastinal primary tumor site. Although mediastinal origin has\\nno effect on prognosis for seminoma (characterized by chemo-\\nsensitivity and excellent outcomes), for nonseminoma, it singularly\\nconfers poor-risk classiﬁcation in the IGCCCG model. Further-\\nmore, within the IGCCCG poor-risk group, having a mediastinal\\nprimary tumor site is considered the most unfavorable charac-\\nteristic as it is associated with the lowest rates of PFS and overall\\nsurvival.7 Thus, to our knowledge, the provocative data in this\\nseries provide, for the ﬁrst time, a genetic and biologic basis for the\\nunique and adverse clinical phenotype of these tumors as com-\\npared with gonadal nonseminoma and mediastinal seminoma.\\nFurthermore, the association of TP53 pathway alterations with\\nshorter PFS independent of the IGCCCG model supports genomic\\nproﬁling of advanced GCT, particularly for patients in the\\nIGCCCG intermediate- and poor-risk groups, to enhance risk\\nC\\nVector\\nWT\\nG12R\\nP34R\\nQ61K\\nQ61R\\nRac1\\nIP-PAK1 PBD\\npPAK1 (T423)\\npMEK1/2 (S217/221)\\nMEK1/2\\nGAPDH\\nKRAS\\nG12\\nG13\\nD33\\nK117\\nA146\\n1\\n5\\n10\\n15\\nRAC1\\nG12\\nP34\\n1\\n5\\nQ61\\nNumber of Mutations\\nKRAS: M\\nM\\nT\\nQ\\nE\\nA\\nY\\nI\\nK L VVV\\nKCVVV\\nG\\nG\\nA\\nDG\\nGG\\nA\\nV\\nV\\nG\\nG\\nK\\nK\\nS\\nT\\nA\\nC\\nL\\nL\\nT\\nL\\nI\\nI\\nQ\\nS\\nL\\nY\\nI\\nT\\nQ\\nT\\nN\\nN\\nH\\nA\\nF\\nF\\nV\\nP\\nD\\nG\\nE\\nE\\nY\\nY\\nD\\nI\\nP\\nP\\nT\\nT\\nI\\nV\\nE\\nF\\nD\\nD\\nS\\nN\\nY\\nY\\nR\\nS\\nK\\nA\\nQ\\nN\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nM\\nI\\nV\\nD\\nD\\nG\\nG\\nE\\nK\\nT\\nP\\nC\\nV\\nL\\nN\\nL\\nL\\nD\\nG\\nI\\nL\\nL\\nW\\nD\\nD\\nT\\nT\\nA\\nA\\nG\\nG\\nQ\\nQ\\nRAC1:\\nP34\\nQ61\\nG12\\nFig 3.

The most common of these was MDM2 ampliﬁcation,\\nwhich has immediate therapeutic implications because seven\\npotent inhibitors of MDM2 are under study in clinical trials with\\npromising results.15 Furthermore, sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors\\nis more pronounced in neuroblastoma cell lines that harbor MYCN\\nampliﬁcation, an alteration observed in four additional TP53 wild-\\ntype but cisplatin-resistant tumors in our cohort.16 The promise of\\nMDM2 inhibitors in patients with GCT is also supported by\\nin vitro studies of the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3, which demon-\\nstrated strong antiproliferative and apoptotic activity and synergy\\nwith cisplatin in TP53 wild-type, cisplatin-resistant GCT cell\\nlines.17,18\\nPotentially targetable alterations were also identiﬁed in the\\nPI3K and RAS RTK pathways. Of particular note, nine activating\\nmutations in RAC1 were identiﬁed and functionally validated.\\nRAC1 is a Rho family GTPase that shares signiﬁcant residue ho-\\nmology to RAS and plays a role in cell proliferation, motility, and\\ndrug resistance.13 RAC1 mutations are rare in human cancers, with\\nonly 38 mutations identiﬁed in 6,076 samples (0.6%) subjected to\\nWES by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thus, to our knowledge, the\\n5% incidence of RAC1 mutations in this cohort makes GCT the\\ncancer type with the highest prevalence of RAC1 mutations re-\\nported to date.14\\nThere are several limitations of this study. Although we\\nidentiﬁed and validated a genetic basis for cisplatin resistance in\\na signiﬁcant proportion of patients with cisplatin-resistant\\ntumors, there remains a large subset of patients for whom\\ncisplatin resistance cannot be explained by the sequencing\\ntechniques and methodologies used in this study. We are thus\\npursuing whole-genome, transcriptome, and epigenome ana-\\nlyses to further deﬁne the mechanisms of treatment resistance in\\nsuch patients. Second, the rate of deaths in the cisplatin-resistant\\ncohort (23.1%) was lower than expected.1 This probably reﬂects both\\nthe relatively short follow-up after progression to ﬁrst-line che-\\nmotherapy for patients with cisplatin-resistant GCT in our cohort, as\\nwell as a high response rate to salvage treatment. In particular, high-\\ndose chemotherapy with stem-cell transplantation has been dem-\\nonstrated to overcome resistance to standard-dose cisplatin in\\na sizable proportion of patients with GCT progressing after ﬁrst-line\\nchemotherapy.19,20 There were too few recurrent genetic abnor-\\nmalities to identify associations with response to speciﬁc salvage\\nchemotherapy regimens in our cohort, but these associations should\\nbe explored in future studies. Third, 49 resistant samples were mixed\\nGCTs that contained teratoma (n = 49), which is known to be\\ncisplatin resistant. Although pure teratomas were excluded from our\\ncohort and we strove to sequence only the nonteratomatous portion\\nof these tumors, we did not perform microdissection. Therefore,\\na small amount of DNA from the teratoma component could have\\nbeen sequenced in some cases. However, the ﬁnding of TP53 and\\nMDM2 alterations within tumors that did not contain any teratoma\\nmakes it unlikely that this had any meaningful effect on our results.\\nFinally, although we identiﬁed actionable genomic alterations within\\ntumors from a signiﬁcant proportion of patients with cisplatin re-\\nsistance, the frequency of each speciﬁc alteration was low, posing\\na challenge to clinical trial enrollment and targeted drug develop-\\nment in this disease.\\nDespite these limitations, this series provides, to our\\nknowledge, the ﬁrst evidence for a genomic basis for cisplatin\\nresistance among a signiﬁcant proportion of patients with ad-\\nvanced GCT. Our data also provides a potential genomic expla-\\nnation for the adverse prognosis associated with speciﬁc clinical\\nfeatures. In particular, we identiﬁed a high rate of TP53 alterations\\namong primary mediastinal nonseminomas, the group of GCT\\nwith the highest rates of chemoresistance and poorest outcomes.\\nFurthermore, the prognostic signiﬁcance of TP53 pathway alter-\\nations independent of the current clinically based IGCCCG\\nprognostic model indicates the potential for genomic sequencing\\nto improve upon current risk stratiﬁcation and provides a rationale\\nfor genomic proﬁling in patients with advanced GCT. Finally, the\\npresence of actionable genomic alterations in nearly half of\\ncisplatin-resistant GCT suggests novel treatment approaches may\\nbe of beneﬁt for patients with refractory GCT and indicates\\na potential advantage of prospective genomic characterization of\\nthese tumors.\\nAUTHORS’ DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS\\nOF INTEREST\\nDisclosures provided by the authors are available with this article at\\nwww.jco.org.\\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\\nConception and design: Aditya Bagrodia, Eugene K.

Any sample with evidence of malignant transformation of teratoma was\\nexcluded. Matched normal DNA was obtained from peripheral blood in ﬁve patients, adjacent nontestis normal parenchyma (eg,\\nlung) in four patients, and adjacent non-neoplastic testis tissue in 10 patients. When adjacent testis tissue was used for comparison\\nagainst normal, the absence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia was pathologically conﬁrmed. Primary and metastatic lesions were\\nincluded in this analysis as were both pre- and postchemotherapy specimens. Between 1.5 and 2 mg of genomic DNA was captured\\nby hybridization using the SureSelect XT Human All Exon V4 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were prepared\\naccording to manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation of the libraries was performed, followed\\nby sample barcoding, and all specimens were sequenced on a HiSEquation 2500 in 100 base pair (bp) paired-end runs using the\\nTruSeq SBS Kit V5 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).\\nSequence Alignment and Mutation Detection\\nSequence alignment and mutation identiﬁcation were performed as previously described (Johnson BE, et al: Science 343:189-\\n193, 2014). Brieﬂy, paired-end sequencing data from exome-capture libraries were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19)\\nwith the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (Li H, et al: Bioinformatics 25:1754-1760, 2009). Deduplication, base quality recalibration, and\\nmultiple-sequence realignment were performed using Picard suite (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and the Genome\\n"), Document(page_content="Analysis Toolkit (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) before mutation detection (McKenna A, et al: Genome Res 20:1297-\\n1303, 2010; and DePristo MA, et al: Nat Genet 43:491-498, 2011). BAM ﬁles were sorted and analyzed for both point mutations and\\nsmall insertions and deletions (indels) of less than 50 bp. Single-nucleotide variants were detected using MuTect (https://www.\\nbroadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect), a Bayesian framework for the detection of somatic mutations and indels using Pindel\\n(https://github.com/genome/pindel; Cibulskis K, et al: Nat Biotechnol 31:213-219, 2013; and Ye K, et al: Bioinformatics 25:2865-\\n2871, 2009).\\nRAC1 Experiments\\nThe coding sequences for wild-type RAC1, RAC1G12R, RAC1P29S, RAC1P34R, RAC1Q61K, and RAC1Q61R were obtained from\\nGenewiz (South Plainﬁeld, NJ), ampliﬁed by PCR to include an N-terminal 33FLAG epitope tag (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,\\nMissouri), and subcloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Expression\\nconstructs were transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), and cells were collected and lysed in\\nradioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer lysis buffer after 48 hours. GTP-bound Rac1, or active Rac1, was isolated via immu-\\nnoprecipitation using recombinant p21-binding domain (PBD) of PAK1 (PAK1-PBD; Active Rac1 Detection Kit, catalog no. 8815;\\nCell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoblots were performed using\\nantiRAC1 (antibody no. 4651), antipMEK1/2 (S217/221) (antibody no. 9121), antipPAK1 (T423; (antibody no. 2601), and anti-\\nMEK1/2 (antibody no. 9122) primary antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology).

Coupled with inferences on subclonal mutations, these data suggest a hypothesis of genetic “predestination,” in which\\nearly driver mutations, typically affecting genes involved in RNA splicing, dictate future trajectories of disease evolution with distinct clinical\\nphenotypes. Driver mutations had equivalent prognostic significance, whether clonal or subclonal, and leukemia-free survival deteriorated\\nsteadily as numbers of driver mutations increased. Thus, analysis of oncogenic mutations in large, well-characterized cohorts of patients illus‐\\ntrates the interconnections between the cancer genome and disease biology, with considerable potential for clinical application.\\nContinuing Medical Education online\\nThis activity has been planned and implemented in accordance with the Essential Areas and policies of the Accreditation Council for\\nContinuing Medical Education through the joint sponsorship of Medscape, LLC and the American Society of Hematology.\\nMedscape, LLC is accredited by the ACCME to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\\nMedscape, LLC designates this Journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)™.

This initial discovery phase has uncovered\\nmany novel genes, pathways, and mutational processes implicated in cancer development.  Now, attention is increasingly turning to understand‐\\ning how these cancer genes knit together, how they influence disease evolution, how they dictate clinical phenotype, and whether they can be\\nused in a diagnostic setting to personalize clinical care.  The considerable complexity observed in cancer genomes suggests that such aspirations\\nwill only be achieved through comprehensive analysis of large cohorts of well-characterized patients. Although initiation of prospective sample\\nascertainment is underway, there is considerable potential to address at least in part some of these questions with established cohorts.\\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematological malignancies that present with abnormal blood counts and a risk of progression to acute\\nmyeloid leukemia (AML).  Diagnosis depends on findings in peripheral blood and bone marrow examination, which can show poor interobserv‐\\ner reliability.  An increasing number of cancer genes have been found to carry recurrent somatic mutations in MDS, including genes involved in\\nsignal transduction (JAK2, KRAS, CBL); DNA methylation (DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2); transcriptional regulation (EVI1, RUNX1, GATA2);\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3837510', 'name': 'Myelodysplastic (MSK, 2020)', 'description': 'Single-cell genomics reveals the genetic and molecular bases for escape from mutational epistasis in myeloid neoplasms', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '24030381', 'citation': 'Papaemmanuil et al.

Contrary to gene discovery studies that routinely screen matched tumor and constitutional\\nDNA, large-scale gene resequencing is applied to tumor samples only. We developed new computational approaches for analysis, variant detec‐\\ntion, determination of clonal phylogenies from limited number of mutations, and evaluation of combined prognostic accuracy of mutations in\\n>100 genes. This unravels a network of complex genetic interactions that define critical steps in disease progression and identify potential diag‐\\nnostic and prognostic biomarkers.\\nMethods\\nPatient samples and targeted DNA sequencing\\nSamples were obtained with written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and appropriate Ethics Committee ap‐\\nprovals from 738 patients (Table 1). Of these, 603 had MDS as subclassified by the World Health Organization in 2008  (with the exception of\\nrefractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts [RCMD-RS], which we maintain from the World Health Organization,\\n2002,  as a separate category), 70 had CMML, 35 had progressive disease (MDS-AML), and 13 were of undefined MDS category or classified\\nas MDS-MPN (including refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis [RARS-T]). Where disease-modify‐\\ning treatment was administered, duration of follow-up was considered complete without reaching the end-point (“censored”) at the time of start‐\\ning disease-modifying treatment (specifically, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, aggressive chemotherapy, or hypomethylating agents).\\nGenomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood granulocytes (n = 431) or bone marrow mononuclear cells (n = 307). Germline DNA was\\nnot generally available.\\nGenomic DNA samples underwent wholegenome amplification. RNA baits were designed to capture a panel of 111 genes (supplemental Table\\n1, found on the Blood Web site) selected on the basis of prior implication in the pathogenesis of myeloid disease by recurrent somatic muta‐\\ntion ; recurrent mutation or aberrations in common cancers ; candidates genes from in-house data; or candidate genes mapping within regions\\nof common copy number alterations.  Sequencing libraries were generated 96-well format, each carrying a unique DNA barcode (supplemental\\nFigure 1) and sequenced on 2 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq.\\n5-16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n19\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3837510', 'name': 'Myelodysplastic (MSK, 2020)', 'description': 'Single-cell genomics reveals the genetic and molecular bases for escape from mutational epistasis in myeloid neoplasms', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '24030381', 'citation': 'Papaemmanuil et al.

In the absence of a matched control sample, it is challenging to distinguish with perfect accuracy between somatic and\\ngermline variants. However, the landscape of truly somatic mutations in these cancer genes has been well established from large-scale genomics\\nstudies,\\n allowing confident predictions to be made. To account for the absence of matched control, we developed a bespoke variant selec‐\\ntion pipeline applying stringent criteria (see supplemental Methods).\\nPotential caveats of our protocol could be (1) that whole genome amplification may result in nonuniform representation of the mutations in the\\ndiagnostic sample; (2) that artifacts may be introduced during the amplification; or (3) that the proportion of DNA molecules representing a vari‐\\nant may not be reflective of the true allele burden in the diagnostic sample. To test these caveats, we used 6 control datasets: (1) exome sequenc‐\\ning of genomic and constitutional DNA for 10 samples that underwent whole genome amplification (WGA) and targeted resequencing; (2) 18\\ntechnical replicates using genomic and WGA DNA; (3) comparison of targeted resequencing results for SF3B1 and TET2 with those obtained\\npreviously ; (4) WGA and targeted gene screen of 22 normal DNA samples; (5) analysis of the 111 genes from 56 normal blood exomes using\\nthe identical bioinformatics pipeline; and (6) exome or whole-genome sequencing data from 317 constitutional DNA samples.\\nStatistical analysis\\nPairwise associations between genes were evaluated by Fisher tests corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. For the 595 patients with available\\noutcome data, leukemia-free survival was the end-point, and log-rank tests were used for univariate hypothesis tests. For multivariate survival\\nanalyses, missing data were estimated by multiple imputation,  and Cox proportional hazards models were built from 3 sets of predictor vari‐\\nables using stability selection.  Accuracy of outcome predictions was averaged across 5 cross-validation samples from models built on the re‐\\nmaining 4 out of 5 patients. We use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  variable selection in Cox’s proportional hazards\\nmethod  and receiver operating characteristic curves to illustrate predictive accuracy.\\nVariant allele fraction estimates were used to evaluate clonal and subclonal variant relationships within each sample. To adjust for the lower\\nmapping qualities associated with indels, we constructed reference genome alignments for each variant to retrieve all reads supporting the variant\\nand produce accurate estimates. We constructed 95% confidence intervals (CI) intervals, taking into account total depth and local copy number\\nstate at the variant position.

The expected pattern of somatic mutations in the given\\ngene was defined from the literature, typically inactivating mutations for tumor suppressor genes and hot-spot mutations for oncogenes. Every\\nvariant identified in this study was then compared against these expected patterns and triaged into “driver mutations,” “possible oncogenic vari‐\\nants,” or “unknown significance” (see supplemental Methods for further details). This definition of driver mutation is not dependent on whether\\nthere is functional evidence of oncogenic potential.\\nStudy controls\\nTo assess whether absence of germline DNA would annotate rare germline polymorphisms as driver mutations, we evaluated calls identified by\\ngene resequencing to those identified by exome analysis from matched tumor and constitutional samples in 10 patients.

Of 738 patients sequenced, credible copy number profiles were generated from 629 (85%).

Importantly, in addition to common copy number alterations, lesions invisible to cytogenetics, such as\\nuniparental disomy, were identified (supplemental Figure 5). Our findings suggest that with further optimization of this preliminary design, po‐\\ntentially by targeting germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), the sensitivity to detect clinically relevant copy number alterations\\ncould be increased.

Similarly, we confirm\\nprevious studies showing mutual exclusivity between mutations in TET2 and IDH2, both linked to disordered DNA hydroxymethylation.\\nFunctional redundancy, however, does not explain all the observed mutually exclusive associations. For example, EZH2 and SRSF2 mutations\\nwere never found together (q = 0.04), although they seemingly operate in different pathways. Similarly, we observe mutually exclusive associa‐\\ntions between some genes and cytogenetic lesions as well as between IDH2 and SF3B1 (Figure 2C). In the latter case, it is striking that IDH2\\nshows a clear proclivity for comutation with SRSF2 (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% CI, 4.9–9.3; q = 0.0004), whereas SRSF2 is mutually exclusive with\\nSF3B1. Thus, apart from functional redundancy, another explanation for mutually exclusivity is that some genes may only be transforming in\\nspecific genomic contexts.\\nIn fact, SF3B1 and SRSF2 show striking differences in their sets of comutated genes. Thus, despite both genes being involved in the same path‐\\nway, the sets of comutated genes are different, implying that the functional consequences on RNA splicing cannot be identical. Furthermore, the\\nfact that SF3B1 is linked to myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts,\\n whereas SRSF2 is particularly enriched in CMML  (Figure 1C), indi‐\\ncates that major differences in disease phenotype can be driven by different combinations of comutated genes. Such relationships appear to un‐\\nderlie patterns of comutation in the study (supplemental Figure 6). These networks of interacting genes provide important clues to the biology of\\nMDS. For example, a mouse model combining Asxl1 loss and Nras, which are comutated, showed a more aggressive, penetrant disease than did\\neither lesion alone,  confirming a biologically relevant interaction.\\nClonal architecture in MDS describes preferred trajectories of disease evolution\\nDuring cancer development, functional mutations drive sequential waves of clonal expansion, and parallel sequencing has enabled this process to\\nbe characterized in some detail.\\n Clonal evolution has been documented as MDS transforms to AML,  and when de novo AML relapses af‐\\nter chemotherapy.  Variant allele fractions can be used to estimate the proportion of tumor cells carrying a given mutation and identify clonal\\nmutations (in all cells) or subclonal (in a fraction of cells).  We applied this approach in patients with 2 or more oncogenic mutations (\\nFigure 3A).\\nApplying this logic across 313 patients with 2 or more driver mutations, 62% showed only clonal driver mutations, and in a further 4% the sub‐\\nclonal fractions were too low to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships (Figure 3B). The remaining 34% of patients had strong statistical evidence\\nfor the existence of clonal as well as subclonal driver mutations in which we could robustly define a set of pairwise precedences reflecting the\\ntemporal order of acquisition. With the large sample size of patients available, there were clear trends across the set of mutated genes, with some\\noccurring consistently earlier than others (supplemental Figure 7).fl\\n10,35\\n34\\n10,11,37\\n10\\n38\\n39-41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3837510', 'name': 'Myelodysplastic (MSK, 2020)', 'description': 'Single-cell genomics reveals the genetic and molecular bases for escape from mutational epistasis in myeloid neoplasms', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '24030381', 'citation': 'Papaemmanuil et al.

Strikingly, mutations in genes involved in RNA splicing and DNA methylation occur early, whereas driver mutations in genes in‐\\nvolved in chromatin modification and signaling often occur later. These are not absolute rules (supplemental Figure 7) but establish robust trends\\nfor the observed temporal acquisition.\\nOur data suggest a hypothesis of genetic “predestination,” that early mutations shape the future trajectories of clonal evolution of a cancer\\nthrough constraints on the repertoire of cooperating genetic lesions. Here, we find that splicing factors such as SF3B1 and SRSF2 are typically\\nmutated early. However, the 2 genes exhibit pronounced and contrasting preferences for which genes are most likely to provide selective advan‐\\ntage subsequently, driving considerable morphologic differences (Figure 1B). We note that this hypothesis is based on inferences from a cross-\\nsectional study. Confirmation would require longitudinal analyses of serial samples drawn from large cohorts.\\nClonal and subclonal mutations affect prognosis equally\\nFollow-up data were available for 595 patients (Table 1). Of 24 genes mutated in >5 patients, 8 genes were associated with significantly worse\\nleukemia-free survival if mutated and 1 gene (SF3B1) with a better leukemia-free survival (supplemental Figure 8). These findings replicate pre‐\\nvious studies.\\nWe assessed whether the effects on clinical outcome of a given gene differed by whether mutations were clonal or subclonal. To explore this, we\\ncompared leukemia-free survival of patients with mutations in the dominant clone to that of patients with mutations in the same gene present in a\\nminor subclone. Strikingly, we found no significant difference in leukemia-free survival between clonal and subclonal mutations for the 6 genes\\nwith published survival effects\\n in which we observed at least 5 patients with subclonal driver mutations (Figure 4), highlighting the impor‐\\ntance of detecting these subclonal mutations. With a challenging classification and a chronic clinical course, this information could enable early\\nidentification of high-risk patients as well as the detection of new emerging subclones of prognostic significance.\\nOutcome correlates with number of driver mutations\\nIn our study, leukemia-free survival negatively correlates with the combined number of oncogenic mutations and cytogenetic lesions (P < .0001;\\nFigure 5A). This remains true if only oncogenic gene mutations (excluding cytogenetic aberrations) are considered (P = .002, supplemental\\nFigure 9) and remains significant independent of TP53 or SF3B1 mutation status. The estimated median leukemia-free survival for patients with\\n1 oncogenic mutation or cytogenetic lesion was 49 months, dropping to 42, 27, 18, and 4 months for patients with 2, 3, 4 to 5, and ≥6 mutations,\\nrespectively. This was mirrored by a monotonic increase in rates of transformation to acute leukemia as the number of driver variants increased\\n(P < .0001; Figure 5B). These data chime with observations that transformation from MDS to AML or relapse of de novo AML is driven by\\nclonal evolution associated with acquisition of new driver mutations.\\n5,9,11,35-37,45,46\\n11,35,46\\n42,43\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC3837510', 'name': 'Myelodysplastic (MSK, 2020)', 'description': 'Single-cell genomics reveals the genetic and molecular bases for escape from mutational epistasis in myeloid neoplasms', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '24030381', 'citation': 'Papaemmanuil et al.

We find that the\\nnumber of oncogenic mutations continues to provide independent prognostic information after stratification by the IPSS classification (P =\\n.0004; supplemental Figure 9).\\nTwenty-two percent of MDS patients showed no evidence of known oncogenic point mutations or cytogenetic aberrations. Patients with no iden‐\\ntified oncogenic events show leukemia-free survival and rates of transformation to acute leukemia similar to those with 1 to 2 driver mutations (\\nFigure 5A-B). This suggests that they have a disease course typical of MDS. Several possible explanations may underlie why we did not identify\\nany mutations in this group. Because we identified no systematic differences in the overall distribution of driver mutations between samples de‐\\nrived from bone marrow and those from peripheral blood, source of DNA is not a major factor. There are several new genes that are targets for\\nrecurrent mutation in myeloid malignancies—such as SETBP1, SMC1A, and SMC3\\n—that were published after this study was performed\\nand could account for a proportion of the unaccounted patients.\\nFurthermore, even in well-characterized genes, there could be rare driver mutations. For example, we found 10 variants in ASXL1 at residues not\\npreviously characterized and consequently annotated as variants of unknown significance. The prognosis for the 10 patients with these mutations\\nwas significantly worse than for patients without ASXL1 variants (P = .03, log-rank test) and tracked the survival curve for patients with known\\noncogenic mutations (Figure 5C). This suggests that at least some of these variants may be of functional importance, although definitive proof\\nwould require establishing that they are somatically acquired, recurrent in a larger cohort, and had prognostic effects independent of other vari‐\\nables.

We therefore explored what proportion of the variance in clinical outcomes could be accounted for by clinical and ge‐\\nnomic features. These include morphological variables, demographic data, peripheral blood counts at diagnosis, cytogenetics, and gene\\nmutations.\\nWe considered 3 potential datasets: the IPSS; a dataset derived from all standard clinical variables (including peripheral blood counts, bone mar‐\\nrow morphology, cytogenetics, and demographic data); and a dataset that combines standard and genetic variables together. Owing to missing\\ndata, we were not able to calculate IPSS—Revised (IPSS-R) status. For each dataset, the variables that had sufficient independent predictive\\npower to enter these models are detailed in supplemental Table 7. When compared with the IPSS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.76 at 90\\nmonths), standard variable sets show an increase in the prognostic potential (AUC = 0.80 at 90 months) in relation to that obtained by the IPSS\\nalone (Figure 6A).

TET2 mutations and del(5q) were the most important genetic predictors of hemoglobin levels, the former being posi‐\\ntively correlated and the latter negatively correlated (Figure 6B).

Similarly, mutations in WT1, IDH2, STAG2, and NRAS, as well as a complex karyotype, correlated strongly with percent‐\\nage of bone marrow blasts, whereas SF3B1 mutations predicted a low fraction of blasts (Figure 6C).\\nTaken together, these data demonstrate that inclusion of genomic data should improve prognostic algorithms for MDS.

To guide clinical decision making, we deﬁned\\nmolecular subtypes of AC associated with patient survival, metastatic burden, and chemotherapy response.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS A comprehensive molecular analysis was performed in patients with AC to deﬁne\\nmolecular subtypes. Associations between molecular subtype and overall survival, intraoperative peritoneal\\ncancer index, and ﬁrst-line chemotherapy response were assessed adjusting for histopathologic and clinical\\nvariables using multivariable Cox proportional hazards, linear regression, and logistic regression models.\\nRESULTS We deﬁned distinct molecular lineages of mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma (MAAP) from co-\\noccurring mutations in GNAS, RAS, and TP53. Of 164 MAAP tumors, 24 were RAS-mutant (mut) predominant\\n(RAS-mut/GNAS-wild-type [wt]/TP53-wt) with signiﬁcantly decreased mutations and chromosomal alterations\\ncompared with tumors with GNAS mutations (GNAS-mut predominant) or TP53 mutations (TP53-mut pre-\\ndominant). No patient with RAS-mut predominant subtype metastatic MAAP died of cancer, and overall survival\\nin this subgroup was signiﬁcantly improved compared with patients with GNAS-mut (P 5 .05) and TP53-mut\\n(P 5 .004) predominant subtypes. TP53-mut predominant subtypes were highly aneuploid; increased tumor\\naneuploidy was independently (P 5 .001) associated with poor prognosis. The ﬁndings retained signiﬁcance in\\npatients with any metastatic AC. RAS-mut predominant metastases exhibited reduced peritoneal tumor bulk\\n(P 5 .04) and stromal invasion (P , .001) compared with GNAS-mut or TP53-mut predominant tumors,\\nrespectively. Patients with RAS-mut predominant MAAP responded more to ﬁrst-line chemotherapy (50%)\\ncompared with patients with GNAS-mut predominant tumors (6%, P 5 .03).\\nCONCLUSION AC molecular patterns identify distinct molecular subtypes: a clinically indolent RAS-mut/GNAS-wt/\\nTP53-wt subtype; a chemotherapy-resistant GNAS-mut predominant subtype; and an aggressive, highly aneuploid\\nTP53-mut predominant subtype. Each subtype exhibits conserved clinical behavior irrespective of histopathology.\\nJ Clin Oncol 41:1553-1564. © 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAppendiceal adenocarcinomas (ACs) encompass di-\\nverse, rare tumors that comprise up to 1% of all gas-\\ntrointestinal cancers.1-3 ACs are conventionally deﬁned\\nby histology.

The ma-\\njority (69%: 57/83) of clonal RAS-mut tumors were TP53\\nwild-type (wt), while only 26% (9/35) of clonal TP53-mut\\ntumors were RAS-wt (Data Supplement), suggesting that\\nwhen RAS and TP53 mutations co-occur, the RAS mutation\\nusually occurs ﬁrst.

Further investigation is needed\\nto resolve these tumors within the molecular and biological\\ntrends seen in the majority of MAAP.\\nOur ﬁndings offer a new perspective on molecular com-\\nplexity as a driver of AC metastatic aggressiveness and\\ndemonstrate the potential value of key mutational patterns\\nin the clinical management of this disease.\\nFIG 4.

Therapeutic targeting of multiple BCL2 family proteins\\nenhances tumor killing but is also associated with increased systemic toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the dual targeting of MCL1 and BCL2\\nproteins using the small molecules S63845 and venetoclax induces durable remissions in mice that harbor human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\\n(DLBCL) tumors but is accompanied by hematologic toxicity and weight loss. To mitigate these toxicities, we encapsulated S63845 or veneto‐\\nclax into nanoparticles that target P-selectin, which is enriched in tumor endothelial cells. In vivo and ex vivo imaging demonstrated preferential\\ntargeting of the nanoparticles to lymphoma tumors over vital organs.

Venetoclax is approved for use in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic\\nleukemia (SLL),  and its safety profile is known.  It is mostly well tolerated, but a recent analysis of 350 CLL patients receiving venetoclax\\nmonotherapy revealed the following hematologic adverse events: 37% had neutropenia, 31% had anemia and 14% had thromobocytopenia.  This\\nis not surprising, given the well-established role of BCL2 in several stages of hematopoietic development as well as adult hematopoietic mainte‐\\nnance.  The safety and potential efficacy of MCL1 inhibitors are currently unknown. Ubiquitous knockout of MCL1 leads to peri-implantation\\nembryonic lethality in mice.

It has also been demonstrated that in the hematopoietic system, BCL2 proteins may act alone or redundantly ; further caution regard‐\\ning toxicity should be used when multiple members of the of BCL2 protein family are inhibited simultaneously.\\nImproving the therapeutic index of combinations of BCL2 protein family inhibitors will be required for the successful development of this strate‐\\ngy for cancer therapy. The essentiality of MCL1 in normal cells can underlie the significant toxicities of such combinations. To combat the toxic‐\\nity of small molecule drugs in normal organs, targeted nanoparticle delivery methods have been used to effectively maximize drug concentra‐\\ntions at tumor sites while reducing the exposure of vital organs to drugs.  Nanoparticles are submicron-size particles up to several hundred\\nnanometers (nm) in size that can be used to encapsulate drugs to prevent the unbiased penetration of the drug upon systemic administration.\\nNanoparticles can be customized for the delivery goal and coated with a tumor-targeting agent such as a protein or polysaccharide.\\n Despite\\nthe potential for nanodelivery systems to dramatically improve the therapeutic indices of their cargoes, this approach is often overlooked until se‐\\nvere toxicities are observed in the clinic. Through a multidisciplinary design that connects cancer biology and pharmacology to nanotechnology,\\nit is possible to anticipate potential issues and solve them in preclinical studies, thus enabling safer, more efficient translation to patients.\\nIn this article, we present a highly efficacious targeted delivery strategy for the dual inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 in lymphoma. Our nanoparti‐\\ncle delivery approach involves a simple vehicle that enables high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of the cargo. First, we report that the\\ndual inhibition of MCL1 (by S63845) and BCL2 (by venetoclax) by using traditional systemic intravenous and/or oral approaches resulted in a\\ndurable remission in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) mouse models but was also associated with significant hematologic toxicity and\\nweight loss. To resolve this issue, we present new formulation strategies for tumor-targeting nanoparticles that encapsulate either S63845 or\\nvenetoclax. Administration of 1 nanoformulation in combination with the other free drug (S63845 nanoparticles plus free venetoclax or free\\nS63845 plus venetoclax nanoparticles) improved the therapeutic index of the combination. Specifically, this approach enabled a 50% decrease in\\nthe drug dose and reduced toxicity while maintaining tumor-killing efficacy in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the\\nadvantage of targeted nanoparticle delivery methods of BH3 mimetics in lymphoma.\\nMethods\\nCell lines and reagents\\nHuman DLBCL-derived cell lines SU-DHL-6, OCI-Ly19, U-2973, SU-DHL-4, SU-DHL-8, Ri-1, and U-2932, and the MCL-derived cell line\\nMaver-1 were obtained from the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell\\nCultures (Braunschweig, Germany).

Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma before being used in any mouse experiment.\\nRoutine mycoplasma testing for all cell lines was performed every 6 months. S63845 (C-1370) was purchased from Chemgood (Glen Allen,\\nVA). A1210477 (A-9036) was purchased from Active Biochem (Kowloon, Hong Kong).

Briefly, logP, the number of high intrinsic\\nstate substructures, and the pKa of the most acidic and basic groups of each drug were determined and used to determine the dye partner and pH\\nof the nanoprecipitation and resuspension conditions. Either S63845 or venetoclax was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 20\\nmg/mL. An aqueous solution consisting of 225 μL of double-distilled water (ddH O), 225 μL of fucoidan (20 mg/mL in ddH O), and 100 μL of\\nIR-783 (2 mg/mL in ddH O) was prepared. Fifty microliters of drug was added dropwise to this aqueous solution under agitation on a vortex\\nmixer. This step was followed by a 10-minute centrifugation at 10\\u2009000 relative centrifugal force [RCF] at room temperature. The nanoparticle\\npellet was resuspended in 200 μL of ddH O for S63845 or sterile 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for venetoclax. Encapsulation efficiency\\nwas quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dynamic light scattering and ζ potential measurements were conducted in PBS\\nusing a Zetasizer Nano ZS size analyzer (Malvern). Dynamic light scattering was conducted with nanoparticles in PBS, and ζ potential was mea‐\\nsured in sterile water to prevent interactions of buffer ions with the nanoparticle surface.

In 4 cell lines, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ) was <0.1 µM (termed sensitive cell lines), 5 cell lines were\\nmoderately sensitive (IC  between 0.1 and 1 µM), and 5 cell lines were resistant (IC  >1 µM). Only 4 cell lines (29%) were sensitive to both\\nMCL1 and BCL2 inhibitors (Figure 1A). Cell lines that were sensitive to S63845 expressed lower levels of the antiapoptotic proteins MCL1,\\nBCL2, and BCL-xL and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 1A [available on the Blood Web site]). Sensitivity to\\nS63845 was observed irrespective of a variety of genetic alterations in BCL2 family members, including TP53 (supplemental Figure 1B) (genet‐\\nic alterations are available at https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=lymphoma_cellline_msk_2020).\\nVenetoclax is a potent and selective BCL2 inhibitor approved for use in patients with CLL and SLL.  Because 57% of the cell lines differential‐\\nly responded to either S63845 or venetoclax (Figure 1A), we examined whether dual inhibition of BCL2 and MCL1 is more effective. In the cell\\nlines assessed, venetoclax enhanced the efficacy of S63845, including in a cell line very resistant to both drugs (Figure 1C; supplemental Figure\\n2A). The combination even demonstrated enhanced activity in the 3 cell lines most resistant to S63845 (U-2932, HBL-1, and Ri-1) or venetoclax\\n(Jeko-1, TMD8, and Z-138) (Figure 1D).\\nTo evaluate the efficacy of the combination of S63845 and venetoclax in vivo, we generated a human DLBCL xenograft model using the SU-\\nDHL-6 cell line (Figure 2A). Monotherapy with S63845 at 25 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) or venetoclax administered at 100 mg/kg\\norally 5 times per week had a modest effect on tumor volume (tumor volume decrease of 41% upon S63845 monotherapy and 36% upon veneto‐\\nclax monotherapy). However, a major impact was observed in mice administered a combination of S63845 and venetoclax: after only 9 treat‐\\nments, we observed complete remission of tumors, which was maintained for up to 216 days (Figure 2A) and increased survival (Figure 2B).\\nImmunohistochemistry and western blot analyses of tumors from different treatment groups revealed that treatment with each drug alone resulted\\nin minimal cleavage of caspase 3 and its target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In contrast, the combination of S63845 and venetoclax re‐\\nsulted in cleavage of both diffuse caspase 3 (Figure 2C-D) and PARP (Figure 2E), indicative of apoptosis.\\nMice treated with the S63845-venetoclax combination suffered significant weight loss of up to ∼15% of their original body weight; this was not\\nobserved in mice treated with each drug alone (Figure 3A-B). Similarly, the combination regimen was more toxic to peripheral blood white\\nblood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) than either drug alone (Figure 3C-F).

Here, we continued to administer venetoclax at 100\\nmg/kg orally 5 times per week and reduced the dose of S63845 (Table 1). IV administration of S63845 at 25 mg/kg 2 or 3 times per week in\\ncombination with venetoclax for 2 weeks led to complete tumor regression by day 20 of treatment (Figure 4A; supplemental Figure 3A). Tumor\\nregression was possible even by combining venetoclax at 100 mg/kg with S63845 at 12.5 mg/kg IV 5 times per week (Figure 4A; supplemental\\nFigure 3A).\\nThe reduced dosing regimens induced complete remissions of tumors in mice, but they were not sustained, and tumor regrowth was observed\\naround day 75 (∼50 days after treatment cessation; Figure 4B; supplemental Figure 3A). The onset and growth of the tumor is dependent on the\\ntotal dose as well as the frequency of administration of S63845 (Table 1). The mice that received S63845 at 50 mg/kg in 1 week (25 mg/kg 2\\ntimes per week) were the first to see tumor regrowth, and these tumors grew faster than tumors in other treatment groups. However, mice that re‐\\nceived S63845 at 12.5 mg/kg 5 times per week (62.5 mg/kg total per week) developed tumors that grew more slowly than those in mice that re‐\\nceived 25 mg/kg 3 times per week (75 mg/kg total per week).

Collectively, these data suggest that the dose of\\nS63845 plus venetoclax required for complete and sustained remission is not well tolerated. To overcome this intolerance, a targeted drug deliv‐\\nery strategy is required. Active targeting of drugs to the tumor can be accomplished with nanoparticles.\\nTumor-targeted delivery of S63845 by nanoparticles is efficacious in vivo\\nTo reduce systemic toxicity of S63845 and venetoclax, we used nanoparticle drug carriers to preferentially target P-selectin, an inflammatory cell\\nadhesion molecule that is significantly upregulated in tumor sites, including lymphomas (supplemental Figure 5A).\\n The nanoparticle formu‐\\nlation of S63845 was designed with 3 key parameters: size, tumor specificity, and ease of visualization. S63845 was first selected for nanoformu‐\\nlation because of its potential toxicity to normal cells when administered systemically.  The nanoparticles are composed of the small molecule\\ndrug S63845, an indocyanine green dye, IR-783, that interacts with the drug and is required for self-assembly into nanoparticles, and fucoidan, a\\nnaturally occurring fucosylated polysaccharide with nanomolar affinity to P-selectin (supplemental Figure 4).\\n Targeting of the drug-loaded\\nnanoparticle to the tumor is achieved by the affinity of fucoidan for P-selectin.\\n Fucoidan-decorated nanoparticles were synthesized by coen‐\\ncapsulating S63845 and IR-783 (supplemental Figure 4). S63845-encapsulating nanoparticles (S63845-NP) demonstrated an in vitro single-\\nagent activity similar to that of free S63845 (supplemental Figure 5B) and synergized with venetoclax as expected (supplemental Figure 5C).\\nIn vivo, the fluorescence intensity of S63845-NP was preferentially localized in the tumors (Figure 5A-E). In control mice that lacked tumors, we\\nobserved ubiquitous distribution of S63845-NP (Figure 5A).

We\\nshowed that the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of S63845 plus venetoclax-NP was associated with selective accumulation of the nanoparticles in\\nthe tumor microenvironment as can be seen by in vivo and ex vivo imaging facilitated by IR-783. We observed up to a sixfold increased fluores‐\\ncence in tumor sites compared with that in normal tissue. This targeted delivery allowed us to achieve an antitumor efficacy similar to that with\\nsystemically administered drug while using 3.5-fold lower doses of S63845 and 6.5-fold lower doses of venetoclax. Encapsulating one drug in\\nnanoparticles while giving the second drug by systemic administration reduced the hematologic toxicity associated with the systemic administra‐\\ntion of both drugs, which confirmed that we are achieving preferential drug delivery to the tumor. The reduction of toxicity was observed by en‐\\ncapsulation of either S63845 or venetoclax into nanoparticles. The sixfold higher affinity of S63845 to human MCL1  would increase the poten‐\\ntial toxicity of S63845 as a single agent and in combination with venetoclax in humans or in a humanized MCL1 mouse model. Thus, quantify‐\\ning how encapsulation into nanoparticles decreases toxicity in such a model would be informative.\\nP-selectin–targeted nanoparticles have been used to encapsulate drugs targeting other types of cancers,\\n but our study is the first to use this\\nstrategy to selectively deliver BH3 mimetics to lymphoma sites. To apply this strategy in a clinical setting, several technical aspects will need to\\nbe addressed, especially the ability to produce a uniform encapsulation of the drugs into nanoparticles. This is essential because the properties of\\nthe particles may change significantly by modest changes in size, charge, and other physiochemical properties. With our methods, venetoclax en‐\\ncapsulation resulted in more uniform small size nanoparticles (68 ± 7 nm) compared with S63845-NP (268 ± 33 nm). Future studies should ex‐\\namine new methods for producing nanoparticles consistent in size and drug loading by using technologies such as nanoprecipitation with hydro‐\\ndynamic flow and microfluidic platforms.\\n An alternative delivery strategy would be to explore conjugation of the BH3 mimetics to antibod‐\\nies that selectively target tumor-associated surface proteins.\\n35\\n36\\n22\\n26\\n10\\n37\\n38\\n10\\n32,39-41\\n42,43\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC8057264', 'name': 'Lymphoma Cell Lines (MSK, Blood 2020)', 'description': 'Targeted sequencing of 34 lymphoma cell lines using HemePACT_v3', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '33067607', 'citation': 'Neeta et al.

Methods: Clinical, histopathologic, and genomic characteristics of EO-CRC patients (2014-2019), divided into age 35\\nyears and younger and 36-49 years at diagnosis, were compared with AO-CRC (50 years and older). Patients with mismatch re-\\npair deﬁcient tumors, CRC-related hereditary syndromes, and inﬂammatory bowel disease were excluded from all but the\\ngermline analysis. All statistical tests were 2-sided. "), Document(page_content="Results: In total, 759 patients with EO-CRC (35 years, n ¼ 151; 36-49 years,\\nn ¼ 608) and AO-CRC (n ¼ 687) were included. Left-sided tumors (35 years and younger ¼ 80.8%; 36-49 years ¼ 83.7%; AO ¼\\n63.9%; P < .001 for both comparisons), rectal bleeding (35 years and younger ¼ 41.1%; 36-49 years ¼ 41.0%; AO ¼ 25.9%; P ¼ .001\\nand P < .001, respectively), and abdominal pain (35 years and younger ¼ 37.1%; 36-49 years ¼ 34.0%; AO ¼ 26.8%; P ¼ .01 and\\nP ¼ .005, respectively) were more common in EO-CRC. Among microsatellite stable tumors, we found no differences in histo-\\npathologic tumor characteristics. Initially, differences in TP53 and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase signaling pathway (RTK-\\nRAS)alterations were noted by age. However, on multivariate analysis including somatic gene analysis and tumor sidedness,\\nno statistically signiﬁcant differences at the gene or pathway level were demonstrated. Among advanced microsatellite stable\\nCRCs, chemotherapy response and survival were equivalent by age cohorts. Pathogenic germline variants were identiﬁed in\\n23.3% of patients 35 years and younger vs 14.1% of AO-CRC (P ¼ .01). Conclusions: EO-CRCs are more commonly left-sided and\\npresent with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain but are otherwise clinically and genomically indistinguishable from AO-\\nCRCs. Aggressive treatment regimens based solely on the age at CRC diagnosis are not warranted.\\nARTICLE\\nReceived: January 28, 2021; Revised: March 29, 2021; Accepted: June 4, 2021\\n© The Author(s) 2021.

It is estimated that, by 2030, 10.9% of all colon\\ncancers and 22.9% of all rectal cancers will be diagnosed in\\npatients younger than 50 years, compared with 4.8% and 9.5%,\\nrespectively, in 2010 (7).\\nThe etiology of this increase in CRC among younger patients\\n(early-onset CRC [EO-CRC]) is unknown, and it is unclear\\nwhether EO-CRC has a unique biology, compared with average-\\nonset CRC (AO-CRC; aged 50 years and older). EO-CRC may be\\nassociated with more aggressive disease biology, resulting in\\nmore advanced stages at diagnosis (8-11). However, because\\npatients aged 50 years and younger do not routinely undergo\\nCRC screening, advanced stage at diagnosis may result from se-\\nlection bias, wherein EO-CRCs are diagnosed only upon devel-\\nopment of symptoms (12). Previous results on EO-CRC tumor\\ngenomics have been mixed and partially confounded by the in-\\nclusion of patients with EO-CRC with well-established genetic\\nand/or medical predispositions for CRC (7,9,13). A recent geno-\\nmic report suggested there are few molecular differences be-\\ntween EO-CRC and AO-CRC, besides an enrichment for high-\\nfrequency microsatellite instability (MSI) in EO-CRC, consistent\\nwith the expected higher prevalence of Lynch syndrome (LS)\\n(14). The majority of cases of EO-CRC are seemingly sporadic,\\noccurring in patients without an identifiable genetic predisposi-\\ntion (15). Established AO-CRC risk factors, such as obesity, diet\\nhigh in red meat and low in fiber, excess alcohol consumption,\\nphysical inactivity, and smoking, do not adequately explain the\\nincrease in EO-CRC (16). Dietary and lifestyle factors have been\\nassociated with an increase in predominantly right-sided CRCs\\n(17); however, the greatest increase in young patients has been\\nin left-sided CRCs (3-5).\\nWhether EO-CRC represents a disease distinct from AO-CRC\\nis an important clinical question with critical implications for\\nthe oncological management of these young adults. To eluci-\\ndate the clinical profile and molecular underpinnings of EO-\\nCRC, we compared the clinical, somatic, and germline charac-\\nteristics of EO-CRC and AO-CRC. As the prevalence of CRC is\\nmost drastically increasing among young individuals (age 35\\nyears and younger), possibly representing a different subgroup\\nof EO-CRC (18-21), we further divided EO-CRC patients by age at\\ndiagnosis (35 years and younger and 36-49 years).\\nMethods\\nPatients\\nWe identified all patients aged younger than 50 years with a\\npathologic\\ndiagnosis\\nof\\nCRC\\n(EO-CRC)\\nat\\nMemorial\\nSloan\\nKettering Cancer Center (MSK) from January 2014 to June 2019.\\nPatients with a known predisposition syndrome for CRC and\\nthose with inflammatory bowel disease were excluded from the\\nclinical and tumor genomic comparisons but were included in\\nthe germline analyses, to provide a comprehensive genetic\\nlandscape. Data including demographic information, family\\nand medical history, pathology, and presenting symptoms were\\nabstracted from the electronic medical record. The study was\\napproved by the MSK Institutional Review Board. Written in-\\nformed consent was obtained from patients for all genomic\\nanalysis.\\nClinical Comparison\\nPatients\\nwith\\nEO-CRC\\nwere\\ncompared\\nwith\\na\\npreviously\\nreported cohort of patients with AO-CRC who were treated at\\nMSK during a similar time frame with identically annotated in-\\nformation (Supplementary Methods, available online) (22). For\\nall comparisons, patients with EO-CRC were further stratified by\\nage at diagnosis: 35 years and younger vs 36-49 years. This was\\nin accordance with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End "), Document(page_content='Results\\ndata, which demonstrate that ages 52 and 36 years are 1 and 2\\nstandard deviations below the mean age at diagnosis of CRC, re-\\nspectively.

To elucidate differences by age\\nat diagnosis of CRC, clinical characteristics were assessed across\\n3 groups: 35 years and younger (n ¼ 151), 36-49 years (n ¼ 608),\\nand 50 years and older (AO). Sex, race, tumor grade, and stage at\\npresentation\\nwere\\nnot\\nstatistically\\ndifferent\\nbetween\\nthe\\ncohorts (Table 1 and Figure 2, A). The majority of patients in all\\ngroups had stage IV disease, reflective of the CRC population\\nthat undergoes next-generation sequencing tumor genomic\\ntesting (Table 1).\\nThe presence of hypertension (35 years and younger ¼ 1.3%;\\n36-49 years ¼ 11.3%; AO ¼ 43.7%; P < .001 for both comparisons),\\ndiabetes (35 years and younger ¼ 2.6%; 36-49 years ¼ 5.4%; AO ¼\\n11.6%; P < .001 for both comparisons), and smoking history\\n(35 years and younger ¼ 16.6%; 36-49 years ¼ 31.9%; AO ¼ 45.1%;\\nP < .001 for both comparisons) progressively increased with age\\nat diagnosis (Table 1). Median body mass index was lower in the\\n35 years and younger cohort than in the AO cohort (24.3 vs\\n27.0 kg/m2; P < .001); the difference in body mass index between\\nthe 36-49 years and AO cohorts was not statistically significant\\n(26.5 vs 27.0 kg/m2; P ¼ .07) (Table 1).\\nRectal bleeding, a presenting symptom, was more common\\nin the EO (35 years and younger ¼ 41.1%; 36-49 years ¼ 41.0%)\\nthan in the AO cohort (25.9%, P ¼ .001 and P < .001, respectively).\\nAbdominal pain or bloating, another presenting symptom, was\\nalso more common in the EO cohorts (\\x0235 years and younger ¼\\n37.1%; 36-49 years ¼ 34.0%; AO ¼ 26.8%; P ¼ .01 and P ¼ .005, re-\\nspectively). Accounting for tumor-sidedness, rectal bleeding\\nwas still more common in EO than AO left-sided CRCs; abdomi-\\nnal pain was more common in EO than AO right-sided CRCs.\\nAnemia was more common in the AO cohort (AO ¼ 14.6%;\\n35 years and younger ¼ 2.0%; 36-49 years ¼ 3.6%; P < .001 for\\nboth comparisons) (Figure 2, B, and Table 1; Supplementary\\nTable 5, available online) irrespective of tumor sidedness.\\nLeft-sided tumors were more common in the EO cohorts\\n(35 years and younger ¼ 80.8%; 36-49 years ¼ 83.7%; AO ¼ 63.9%;\\nP < .001 for both comparisons), as was rectal cancer (both EO\\ncohorts ¼ 33.7%; AO ¼ 22.6%; P ¼ .007 and P < .001, respectively)\\n(Figure 2, C).\\nSomatic Mutation Analyses of EO-CRC of Microsatellite\\nStable (MSS) CRC\\nUsing MSK-IMPACT, we assessed somatic alterations in EO-CRC\\nand AO-CRC. To eliminate bias in the genomic analysis intro-\\nduced by hypermutated tumors with MSI, the comparison was\\nlimited to MSS tumors (35 years and older, n ¼ 142; 36-49 years,\\nn ¼ 588; AO, n ¼ 626) (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 1, available\\nonline).\\nThe most common alterations in EO-CRCs were APC (78.7%),\\nTP53 (82.1%), KRAS (42.5%), SMAD4 (15.5%), PIK3CA (14.9%),\\nFBXW7 (8.9%), SOX9 (7.7%), TCF7L2 (7.2%), and BRAF (5.5%). The\\nfrequency of oncogenic driver mutations did not differ between\\nthe 3 cohorts, except that TP53 alterations were enriched in the\\n36-49 years cohort, compared with the AO cohort (82.1% vs\\n73.5%; q ¼ 0.1). Receptor Tyrosine Kinase signaling pathway\\n(RTK-RAS) alterations were less frequent in the 36-49 cohort\\nthan in the AO cohort (64.6% vs 71.7%; q ¼ 0.04) (Figure 3, A;\\nSupplementary Figure 2, A, available online). However, after ad-\\njustment for tumor location, the differences in the prevalence\\nof TP53 and RTK-RAS pathway alterations, among all cohorts,\\nwere no longer statistically significant at the gene or pathway\\nlevel (Figure 3, B and C; Supplementary Figure 2, B, available on-\\nline). To assess for genomic differences possibly masked by the\\ninclusion of patients close to age 50 years at diagnosis, we com-\\npared extreme age cohorts (35 years and younger vs older than\\n70 years); no statistically significant differences were observed\\n(Figure 3, C). No statistically significant differences in tumor\\nmutational burden, fraction of genome altered, whole-genome\\nduplication, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were observed\\n(Supplementary Figure 2, C, available online).\\nClinical Outcomes of Metastatic EO-CRC\\nWe then compared clinical outcomes between EO-CRC and AO-\\nCRC by evaluating response to therapy and survival. Our analy-\\nsis focused on patients with MSS tumors who had metastatic\\ndisease (35 years and younger, n ¼ 110; 36-49 years, n ¼ 455; AO,\\nn ¼ 574) (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 1, available online). We\\nfound that the use and type of first-line chemotherapy, the site\\nof first metastases, and metastastectomy frequency were simi-\\nlar between cohorts and therefore did not confound survival\\ndata (Table 1). The majority of patients (69.6%) EO 35 years and\\nyounger, (66.3%), EO 36-49 years, and (72.4%) AO received fluoro-\\npyrimidine plus oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab as\\nfirst-line chemotherapy. Radiographic response to first-line\\nchemotherapy (35 years and younger ¼ 71.9%; 36-49 years ¼\\n61.8%; AO ¼ 66.5%; P ¼ .36 and P ¼ .70, respectively) and median\\noverall survival (35 years and younger ¼ 46.9 months; 36-\\n49 years\\n¼\\n56.4 months;\\nAO\\n¼\\n54.5 months;\\n35 years\\nand\\nyounger vs AO, P ¼ .90; and 36-49 years vs AO P ¼ .17, respec-\\ntively) were not statistically different among the 3 cohorts\\n(Figure 3, D and E).\\nOn univariate analysis, metastasectomy, tumor grade, and\\npresence of APC alterations or 20q amplification in the tumor,\\nBRAF alterations, and SMAD4 alterations were statistically sig-\\nnificantly associated with survival. Notably, age was not statis-\\ntically\\nsignificantly\\nassociated\\nwith\\nsurvival.\\nVariables\\nstatistically significant on univariate analysis were incorporated\\ninto a multivariate model with the additional inclusion of age.\\nAgain, after adjustment for the statistically significant variables,\\nage was not statistically significantly associated with outcome\\n(Figure 3, F).

Exclusive of patients\\nwith a hereditary predisposition for CRC, we found that more\\nthan 80% of EO-CRC patients presented with left-sided CRCs—\\nand nearly one-third presented with rectal cancer—which is\\nconsistent with prior reports (5,33). Patients with EO-CRC were\\nmore likely to present with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain\\nbut were less likely to present with anemia, which may reflect\\ntumor location and possibly more routine blood count evalua-\\ntions in older individuals.\\nMultiple studies have suggested that patients with EO-CRC\\npresent with more advanced disease (8-11,34), owing to a tumor\\nbiology that is inherently more aggressive (8,35). This, in turn,\\nhas led to more aggressive treatment regimens in young\\npatients, with chemotherapy overuse but without matched sur-\\nvival improvement (36,37). Our study found no statistically sig-\\nnificant difference in tumor grade—a marker of tumor biology—\\nbetween patients with EO-CRC and patients with AO-CRC. MSI\\nCRCs, which are often enriched in poorly differentiated adeno-\\ncarcinomas (38), were excluded from this assessment; prior\\nstudies may have been confounded by the expected higher inci-\\ndence of LS-associated MSI tumors among patients with EO-\\nCRC (8,15). Similarly, our tumor genomic analysis was limited to\\nMSS CRCs; no statistically significant differences in CRC-driver\\npathway gene alterations were observed between cohorts. In\\ncontrast to the lower rates of BRAF V600E and APC variants ob-\\nserved in EO-CRCs (14), no statistically significant differences in\\nthe prevalence of these mutations were observed after adjust-\\nment for MSI status and tumor sidedness, a factor associated\\nwith distinct molecular characteristics (22). The higher preva-\\nlence of TP53 mutations among MSS EO-CRCs, compared with\\nAO-CRCs, was not statistically significant after adjustment for\\ntumor side; this may account for contrasting results with prior\\nstudies that noted increased rates of APC and TP53 mutations\\namong EO-CRCs when sidedness was not considered (39).\\nA key strength of our study is its focus on patients with CRC\\nwithout known clinical predispositions to CRC; thus, we evalu-\\nated the exact EO-CRC population with the most dramatic\\nincreases in the incidence of CRC. Contrary to previous results\\n(40,41), we observed no statistically significant differences in\\nclinical outcomes between metastatic MSS EO-CRC and AO-\\nCRC. Importantly, this lack of difference could not be attributed\\nto more aggressive therapy in patients with EO-CRC, as we\\nassessed the type of chemotherapy and response to first-line\\nchemotherapy and found no statistically significant differences\\nbetween cohorts. Moreover, the use of locoregional interven-\\ntions, such as surgery, were not statistically different between\\nthe cohorts. Prior studies have also demonstrated comparable\\noutcomes between patients with EO-CRC and those with AO-\\nCRC (42,43). Late stage of presentation noted in prior studies of\\nEO-CRC may reflect a delay in diagnosis, as opposed to a differ-\\nent disease biology. Indeed, more than half of EO-CRC patients\\nwait up to 1 year from the onset of presenting symptoms to\\nseek medical care and are evaluated by an average of 3 medical\\nproviders before diagnosis (34,44).\\nOur germline analysis revealed that, among patients with\\nvery early-onset CRC, the prevalence of germline mutations\\nwas especially high at 23% because of a near doubling of muta-\\ntions in high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes. The rate of\\nmutations in high- and moderate-penetrance genes was similar\\nto that in prior publications, after adjustment for number of\\ngenes tested (45). Our integrated germline and somatic analysis\\nhelped further elucidate the role of these germline variants in\\nCRC carcinogenesis. Biallelic inactivation, resulting from so-\\nmatic mutation or LOH in the tumor, was present in nearly all\\npatients with mutations in a high-penetrance CRC susceptibility\\ngene and in a higher proportion of patients aged 35 years and\\nyounger, compared with older patients.

As is\\nexpected in an older population, our AO-CRC patients had\\nhigher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension,\\nand obesity. Importantly, the selective pressure or insult that\\nhas shifted the development of CRC to younger populations\\nover the past few decades appears to be steady, persistent, and\\nglobally occurring (16). It therefore seems to reason that exter-\\nnal or environmental factors are likely to be driving earlier CRC\\ndevelopment, and further investigations, using appropriately\\nmatched control populations, are necessary.\\nAlthough our study represents the largest comprehensive\\nanalysis of EO-CRCs to date, it is a retrospective, single-\\ninstitution analysis. To attempt to overcome potential referral\\nand other demographic biases pertinent to our tertiary-care\\ncancer center, EO-CRC patients were compared with AO-CRC\\npatients who were treated at our institution, with identical clin-\\nical annotations and genomic profiling, during a similar time\\nframe. Furthermore, although the age groups are balanced eth-\\nnically, representation of Black and Hispanic patients is low. To\\ndate, no statistically significant differences have been noted;\\nhowever, we and other researchers are actively pursuing na-\\ntional and international collaborations evaluating EO-CRC geno-\\nmics in more diverse populations (51).\\nUnlike prior reports, our study demonstrates that, after ad-\\njustment\\nfor\\nknown\\nconfounders,\\nsporadic\\nEO-CRCs\\nare\\ngenomically equivalent to AO-CRCs. Inherited genetic suscepti-\\nbility, although higher in EO-CRCs, explains only a fraction of all\\nEO-CRCs. We highlight the importance of the lack of genomic\\nand biological differences in this disease, as initial reports de-\\nscribed EO-CRC as a potentially different and more aggressive\\ndisease entity leading many clinicians to select more intense\\ntreatments (36,37). Our results demonstrate that clinical out-\\ncomes and response to chemotherapy are the same and that ag-\\ngressive treatment regimens based solely on the age at CRC\\ndiagnosis are not warranted. Further research should be fo-\\ncused on evaluating diverse populations and identifying poten-\\ntial environmental risk factors that are contributing to this shift\\nin incidence to better distinguish the young population at risk\\nand improve outcomes in this disease.\\nFunding\\nThis work was supported by the National Cancer Institute\\n(P30 CA008748); the National Institutes of Health (T32\\nGM132083; R25 CA233208); Stand Up to Cancer Colorectal\\nCancer Dream Team Translational Research Grant (SU2C-\\nAACR-DT22-17).

These well-differentiated tumors were \\nfound to have a low frequency of somatic alterations (2), with the \\nmajority harboring mutually exclusive activating mutations in \\nBRAF (60%) and RAS-family genes (13%), as well as fusion onco-\\nproteins, primarily involving receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) \\nsuch as RET, NTRK1 or -3, and ALK. Distinct signaling and tran-\\nscriptomic consequences were observed between BRAFV600E-like \\ntumors, which showed higher MAPK transcriptional output and \\nlower expression of genes involved in iodine metabolism, and \\nRAS-like tumors, which had lower MAPK signaling and compara-\\ntively preserved expression of iodine-related genes.\\nThe TCGA study excluded poorly differentiated thryoid can-\\ncers (PDTCs) and anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATCs) from their \\nanalysis in order to focus on a homogeneous histological cohort \\nthat would provide sufficient power to identify low-frequency \\ngenomic events. Although PDTCs and ATCs account for approx-\\nimately 5%–10% of thyroid cancers, they represent a major clini-\\ncal challenge. Patients with PDTC and ATC have a mean survival \\nafter diagnosis of 3.2 and 0.5 years, respectively, and account for \\napproximately a third of deaths caused by this disease (3). Virtu-\\nally all cases are refractory to radioiodine therapy, and traditional \\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy are of marginal benefit (4, 5). \\nMolecularly targeted approaches are being tested in preclinical \\nBACKGROUND. Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) are rare and frequently lethal \\ntumors that so far have not been subjected to comprehensive genetic characterization.\\nMETHODS. We performed next-generation sequencing of 341 cancer genes from 117 patient-derived PDTCs and ATCs and \\nanalyzed the transcriptome of a representative subset of 37 tumors. "), Document(page_content="Results were analyzed in the context of The Cancer \\nGenome Atlas study (TCGA study) of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC).\\nRESULTS. Compared to PDTCs, ATCs had a greater mutation burden, including a higher frequency of mutations in TP53, TERT \\npromoter, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway effectors, SWI/SNF subunits, and histone methyltransferases. BRAF and RAS were \\nthe predominant drivers and dictated distinct tropism for nodal versus distant metastases in PDTC. RAS and BRAF sharply \\ndistinguished between PDTCs defined by the Turin (PDTC-Turin) versus MSKCC (PDTC-MSK) criteria, respectively. Mutations \\nof EIF1AX, a component of the translational preinitiation complex, were markedly enriched in PDTCs and ATCs and had a \\nstriking pattern of co-occurrence with RAS mutations. While TERT promoter mutations were rare and subclonal in PTCs, they \\nwere clonal and highly prevalent in advanced cancers. Application of the TCGA-derived BRAF-RAS score (a measure of MAPK \\ntranscriptional output) revealed a preserved relationship with BRAF/RAS mutation in PDTCs, whereas ATCs were BRAF-like \\nirrespective of driver mutation. \\nCONCLUSIONS. These data support a model of tumorigenesis whereby PDTCs and ATCs arise from well-differentiated \\ntumors through the accumulation of key additional genetic abnormalities, many of which have prognostic and possible \\ntherapeutic relevance. The widespread genomic disruptions in ATC compared with PDTC underscore their greater virulence \\nand higher mortality. \\nFUNDING.

Clinicopathological features are summa-\\nrized in Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1 (supplemental material \\navailable online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI85271DS1). \\nMedian age was 58 and 66 years for PDTC and ATC, respectively. \\nFemale/male ratios were 1.5:1 (PDTC) and 1.2:1 (ATC), which are \\ndistinct from PTC (2.7:1) (25). Most samples were primary tumors: \\n92/117 (64/84 PDTC; 28/33 ATC), and the remainder from nodal \\n(6) or distant (19) metastases.\\nMSK-IMPACT, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform \\nfor targeted sequencing of 341 cancer genes (24), was performed \\nin all 117 tumors. A subset of 37 (17 PDTCs and 20 ATCs) was also \\nsubjected to an mRNA expression array and a CGH platform to \\nvalidate IMPACT-derived copy number calls, as detailed later. \\nMedian tumor purity was 72% and 42% for PDTCs and ATCs, \\nrespectively, consistent with the known heavy macrophage infil-\\ntration in ATCs and highlighting the need for deeper sequence \\ncoverage in these tumors (Figure 1B). Average depth of coverage \\nwas 584× for tumors and 236× for paired normal tissues. Average \\ncoverage was 500× and 765×, for FFPE and frozen tumors, respec-\\ntively. Coverage for ATCs was 739×.\\nSomatic mutations\\nATCs harbored a higher number of mutations than PDTCs (median \\n± interquartile range [IQR]: 6 ± 5 and 2 ± 3, respectively, P < 1 × 10–4) \\n(Figure 1A). The mutation burden in PDTCs was increased com-\\npared with the PTCs from the TCGA study (considering mutations \\nin the 341 gene set only): 2 ± 3 and 1 ± 1, respectively (P < 1 × 10–4). \\nThese differences remained highly significant after removing \\ntumors with defects in mismatch excision repair (MMR) genes, \\nwhich showed a disproportionately higher number of mutations. \\nMutation burden in PDTCs (expressed as number of mutations \\nbelow, equal, or above the median) was greater in older patients (47 \\nvs. 58 vs. 64 years, P < 1 × 10–3) and associated with tumor size (36% \\nvs. 43% vs. 71% > 4 cm, P = 0.04), presence of distant metastasis \\n(8% vs. 29% vs. 57%, P = 2 × 10–3), and overall survival (19% vs. 25% \\nvs. 46%, logrank P = 0.01) (Supplemental Table 2).\\nDrivers and frequently altered genes. BRAFV600E mutations were \\npresent in 33% of PDTCs and 45% of ATCs, whereas mutations in \\nNRAS, HRAS, or KRAS occurred in 28% and 24% of PDTCs and \\nATCs, respectively, and were mutually exclusive with BRAF and \\ngene fusions (Figure 1, C and D, and Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). \\nThere was a dichotomy in the distribution of RAS and BRAF muta-\\ntions of PDTCs according to their histological features. Ninety-\\xad\\nstudies and in early human clinical trials (6, 7). These efforts are \\nconstrained by the paucity of information on the genomics of \\nthese cancers, which have been investigated primarily through \\nSanger sequencing of a limited set of candidate genes (8–20). The \\nexception to this is a recently reported whole exome sequencing \\nstudy of ATC (21), which, although informative, may have under-\\ncalled significant mutations — particularly those that are sub-\\nclonal — because of low tumor purity. This is because ATCs, and \\nto a lesser extent PDTCs, pose a particular challenge for genomic \\nstudies due to their extensive infiltration by macrophages (22, \\n23). This cannot be overcome by microdissection of tissue sam-\\nples because the macrophages form an interconnected network \\nthat envelops the individual tumor cells throughout the tumor \\nspecimen. To overcome this, we adopted an ultradeep sequencing \\nstrategy using the MSK-IMPACT cancer exome panel, a massively \\nparallel exon capture approach that targets all exons and selected \\nintrons of 341 genes frequently altered in human cancer (24). We \\nperformed this extensive cancer gene exome sequencing as well \\nTable 1.

EIF1AX mutations were associated with \\nlarger tumors and predicted for shorter survival in PDTCs (Figure \\n2C and Supplemental Table 6).\\nTERT in advanced thyroid cancer. There was a high prev-\\nalence of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter \\nmutations in these advanced thyroid tumors, and their pres-\\nence was associated with aggressive and metastatic phenotypes \\n(Figure 1E). Together, 40% of PDTCs and 73% of ATCs har-\\nbored TERT promoter mutations (49/117 C228T [c.-124G>A]; \\n8/117 C250T [c.-146G>A]) as compared with 9% of PTCs from \\nTCGA (Figure 3, A and B, and Table 3). Whereas TERT pro-\\nmoter mutations were subclonal in the small subset of PTC that \\nharbored them, they were clonal in PDTC and ATCs (Figure \\n3C). TERT mutations co-occurred with BRAF/RAS mutations in \\nPDTCs and ATCs combined (P = 4 × 10–3, Figure 3B and Table \\n3), consistent with the proposed mechanism whereby the TERT \\nmutations generate de novo binding elements for ETS-fam-\\nily transcription factors activated by MAPK signaling, such as \\nGABPA (29). Survival of ATC patients harboring TERT promoter \\nmutations was markedly diminished (732 vs. 147 days, P = 0.03, \\nSupplemental Table 7), particularly in cancers with coexisting \\nmutations of BRAF or RAS (Figure 3D). TERT-\\xad\\nmutated PDTCs \\ndeveloped more distant metastases (56% vs. 20%, P = 0.01) and \\nhad a trend toward greater mortality (Supplemental Table 7). \\nRAS-mutant ATCs with TERT (5/8) and EIF1AX mutations (3/8) \\ndid not overlap (odds ratio = 0.01; P = 0.02), consistent with alter-\\nnate pathways toward progression to ATC.\\nTP53 and other tumor-suppressor genes. Inactivation of p53 has \\nbeen considered as a hallmark of advanced thyroid tumors (14, 30). \\nWe found that TP53 mutations, although highly prevalent in ATCs, \\nwere relatively rare in PDTCs (73% vs. 8%, P < 1 × 10–4, Figure 1F), \\nwhich contrasts with previous reports (refs. 11, 31, and Supplemen-\\ntal Table 8) and constitutes a key distinguishing event in the biol-\\nogy of these tumors. ATM, a cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA dam-\\nage response gene, was mutated in 7% of PDTCs and 9% of ATCs. \\nATM-mutated tumors had a higher mutation burden: median was \\n5 and 2 in ATM-mutant versus WT PDTCs (P = 0.04), and 19 and \\n5.5 in ATC, respectively (P = 7 × 10–3). A higher mutation burden is \\nconsistent with the loss of the canonical function of this checkpoint \\nkinase, which is activated in response to DNA double strand breaks \\nand is required for appropriate DNA repair (32). Infrequent trun-\\ncating mutations were also found in RB1, NF2, and MEN1.\\nNovel genes and pathways altered in advanced thyroid tumors. Muta-\\ntions of genes encoding members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway \\nwere seen more frequently in ATCs than PDTCs (39% vs. 11%, P = 1 \\n× 10–3). Besides PIK3CA and PTEN, mutations of PIK3C2G, PIK3CG, \\nPIK3C3, PIK3R1, PIK3R2, AKT3, TSC1, TSC2, and MTOR were also \\npresent (Figure 1G, Figure 4, A and E, and Supplemental Figure 1).\\nGenes encoding components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remod-\\neling complex were mutated in 36% of ATCs and 6% of PDTCs \\n \\n(P = 1 × 10–4). This is the first report of mutations in ARID1A, ARID1B, \\nARID2, ARID5B, SMARCB1, PBRM1, and ATRX genes in advanced \\nthyroid tumors. Consistent with evidence that disruption of one \\nprotein in this complex is typically sufficient to impair function (33), \\nwe observed a pattern of mutual exclusivity of mutations in this cat-\\negory of genes (Figure 4B). The single exception was for an ATC \\nwith concurrent missense mutations in ARID1A (minor allele fre-\\ntwo percent of RAS mutations were found in PDTCs fulfilling the \\nTurin definition of the disease (PDTC-Turin; see Methods, ref. \\n26). By contrast, 81% of BRAF mutations were found in PDTCs \\ndefined based only on MSKCC criteria (PDTC-MSK): high mitotic \\nrate and necrosis irrespective of growth pattern (ref. 27 and Figure \\n1, B and C). BRAF-mutant PDTCs were smaller and had higher \\nfrequency of nodal metastases, whereas their RAS-mutant coun-\\nterparts were larger and had a higher rate of distant metastasis \\n(Supplemental Table 5). BRAF-mutant PDTCs were significantly \\noverrepresented among female patients (P = 0.005).\\nNeurofibromin 1 gene (NF1) mutations were identified in 3 \\nBRAF/RAS WT ATCs. There were also low-frequency mutations in \\nTSHR and STK11 in both PDTCs and ATCs (Figure 1C). Mutations \\nin PIK3CA and PTEN, which encode key effectors of the PI3K/\\nAKT pathway, were particularly prevalent in ATCs (18% and 15%, \\nrespectively, Supplemental Table 3) and were overrepresented with \\nrespect to PDTCs (P = 4 × 10–2 and 6 × 10–3, respectively). PIK3CA \\nand PTEN showed distinct patterns of co-occurrence in ATCs. All \\n3 ATCs harboring NF1 mutations also had truncating alterations in \\nPTEN (P = 2 × 10–3), whereas PIK3CA and BRAF mutations tended \\nto co-occur. All 5 PIK3CA helical domain mutations (E542K or \\nE545K) occurred in ATCs, whereas the single kinase domain muta-\\ntion (H1047R) was found in a PDTC (Figure 1C).\\nThe EIF1AX-RAS association. Mutations in the eukaryotic \\ntranslation initiation factor EIF1AX were initially discovered \\nin uveal melanomas (28) and were also reported in 1% of PTCs \\n(6/402), largely occurring in a mutually exclusive manner with \\nBRAF and RAS (1). By contrast, 11% of PDTCs and 9% of ATCs \\nharbored EIF1AX mutations (Figure 1C and Figure 2A), which \\nwere strongly associated with RAS (14/15, P < 1 × 10–4, Figure \\n2B and Table 2). EIF1AX mutations clustered in two regions: the \\nN-terminal domain, as also observed in uveal melanomas (28) \\nand other tumors (Figure 2A), or at a unique splice acceptor site \\nbetween exons 5 and 6 (p.A113splice), which was the most preva-\\nlent abnormality and which has not been reported in other tumor \\ntypes. The C-terminal p.A113 splice mutation predicts for alterna-\\ntive usage of a cryptic splice acceptor within exon 6, resulting in \\na 12–amino acid in-frame deletion. Our analysis of RNASeq data \\nfrom two cases with this mutation in the PTC-TCGA confirms this \\nFigure 1. Cancer genome alterations in 84 PDTCs and 33 ATCs.

It clearly represents \\nan outlier from the clinical behavior standpoint, which matches \\nwith her unique genetic alteration, involved in large-scale chro-\\nmatin remodeling (34).\\nSomatic CNAs\\nTumor purity of PDTCs was similar to PTCs (median tumor con-\\ntent 74% and 72%, respectively) whereas it was much lower in ATCs \\n(42%) (Supplemental Figure 2). By correcting for tumor purity, we \\ngreatly enhanced our sensitivity for detecting CNAs even in most \\nof the heavily infiltrated ATCs, as well as in some PDTCs. The abil-\\nity of IMPACT to call arm-level CNAs was explored in 37 tumors \\nthat were simultaneously profiled by array-CGH. As seen in Sup-\\nplemental Figure 3, CNA calls were efficiently replicated in both \\nplatforms. In addition, IMPACT identified CNAs that were not \\ndetected by array-CGH, particularly in heavily infiltrated tumors.\\nWhereas the genome of PTCs is largely diploid, CNAs in \\nadvanced thyroid tumors were common and widespread (Sup-\\nplemental Figure 4). Interestingly, CNAs were more frequent in \\nthe ATCs and PDTCs that lacked driver mutations (Figure 5A). A \\nsimilar subset of PTCs from the TCGA analysis also possessed a \\nhigh prevalence of CNAs in the absence of driver mutations (1). \\nOverall, 8 arm-level recurrent CNAs (losses of 1p, 8p, 13q, 15q, 17p, \\n22q, and gains of 1q and 20q; Figure 5A) were present at higher \\nprevalence, an effect that persisted at a more conservative copy \\nnumber threshold (see Methods).\\nMost of the CNAs occurred in a tumor type– and gene con-\\ntext–specific fashion (Figure 5B). Loss of 1p was marginally more \\nfrequent in PDTCs (P = 0.06), whereas 8p and 17p losses and 20q \\ngains were far more frequent in ATC genomes (P < 2 × 10–4 for \\nall three). Chromosome 1p, 13q, and 15q losses were enriched in \\nPDTCs without known driver mutations (χ2 P = 0.03, 2 × 10–3, and \\n3 × 10–4, respectively), whereas loss of 22q was strongly associ-\\nated with RAS-mutated PDTCs as compared with BRAF tumors \\n(P = 1 × 10–3) (Figure 5A).\\nThree out of 8 of the recurrent CNAs in the genomes of PDTCs \\nand ATCs were associated with outcome. Patients with PDTCs \\nwith gains in chromosome 1q had worse survival (log-rank P = 0.06) \\n(Figure 5C). In ATCs, 13q losses and 20q gains were associated \\nwith shorter survival (log-rank P = 0.02 and 0.06, respectively).\\nGene expression profiling: signaling and differentiation\\nWe used a subset of fresh-frozen specimens of 17 PDTCs and \\n20 ATCs to derive insights into the gene expression profiles of \\nadvanced thyroid cancers. The 37-tumor dataset was representa-\\ntive of the main driver genetic alterations described and included \\n13 BRAF, 12 RAS, 5 with alterations in other drivers (NF1, NCOA4-\\nRET, CCDC149-ALK, NUT-BRD4, and STK11), and 7 without \\nknown driver mutations (Supplemental Table 9).\\nA principal component analysis efficiently separated both \\nentities based on their global gene expression (Figure 6A). Only \\n2 tumors clustered out of their tumor type group: an ATC from a \\nmetastatic specimen (the single one in this subset of 20 ATCs) \\nand a BRAF-mutant PDTC that was heavily infiltrated with mac-\\nrophages (tumor purity = 46%, high M2-macrophage signature \\nscore, see also Figure 7A).\\nMAPK signaling: the BRAF-RAS score. As a consequence of \\ntheir genomic simplicity, the key oncogenic drivers of PTCs are \\nassociated with distinct biological, signaling, and gene expres-\\nsion properties. Pertaining to this study, the recently published \\nTCGA analysis of 390 PTCs showed clear gene expression dif-\\nferences between BRAF and RAS tumors, which were used to \\nconstruct a BRAF-RAS score (BRS) (1). We aimed to evaluate \\nwhether these driver-dependent gene expression characteristics \\npersist in advanced cancers, which harbor a more complex cancer \\ngenome. Sixty-seven out of the 71 genes in the BRS were present \\nin the mRNA array and were assessed in our PDTCs and ATCs \\nwith known driver mutation status. We found a high correlation \\nbetween BRS values and BRAF/RAS mutation status (Figure 6, B \\nand C). All 13 BRAFV600E-mutated PDTCs and ATCs were BRAF-\\nlike. However, although RAS-mutant PDTCs were strongly RAS-\\nlike, RAS-mutant ATCs were BRAF-like (P = 3 × 10–3), suggesting \\nthat a high MAPK transcriptional output is a characteristic prop-\\nerty of ATCs, regardless of the driver mutation (Figure 6C and \\nSupplemental Figure 5).\\nMacrophage infiltration. ATCs are known to be extensively \\ninfiltrated with macrophages (22, 23). Although it is assumed that \\nthese are M2 macrophages, which promote tumorigenesis, this \\nhas not been proven. We applied a previously characterized sig-\\nnature (35) of 78 genes overexpressed in M2 macrophages (68 of \\nwhich were represented in our array) to the 37 tumors (Figure 7A \\nand Supplemental Figure 6) and found that it was sufficient to dis-\\ncriminate ATCs from the great majority of PDTCs, which are less \\nprone to macrophage infiltration. The only 3 PDTCs that clustered \\nwith ATCs had a lower median estimated tumor purity than the \\nTable 3.

In addition, RAS- and BRAF-mutant PDTCs have distinct \\ntropism for metastases, with the former tending to home at a dis-\\ntance, whereas the latter metastasize to locoregional lymph nodes. \\nMoreover, the discovery in well-differentiated tumors of sub-\\nclonal mutations of genes that we show to be enriched in advanced \\ndisease should raise particular concerns. This also opens a path to \\nexplore the biology of novel genetic associations that may point to \\ntumor dependencies that can be exploited therapeutically.\\nMethods\\nPatient tissue samples. PDTC and ATC samples were randomly \\nselected from the pathology department files of the institution \\nfrom 1986–2015. ATCs were classified according to the last WHO \\nclassification of endocrine tumors, whereas PDTCs were defined \\nas follows: (i) according to the Turin proposal, by architectural and \\nhigh-grade features (mitosis and necrosis), the presence of a solid/\\nnested/insular growth, the absence of nuclear features of PTC, \\nand either convoluted nuclei, mitotic activity ≥ 3 × 10 high power \\nfields (HPF), or tumor necrosis (26); and (ii) as a carcinoma display-\\na monomer and is unresponsive to this constraint, resulting in a \\ngreater flux through the pathway (1, 43). We found that these sharp \\ndemarcations between BRAF- and RAS-mutant disease persisted \\nin PDTC but were largely lost in ATC. PDTCs that met the stan-\\ndard histological definition of that entity (Turin proposal, ref. 26) \\nwere strongly associated with RAS mutations. By contrast, those \\ndefined based on the presence of high mitotic rate and necrosis \\nirrespective of other characteristics (27) were markedly enriched \\nfor BRAF. They also had distinct clinical behaviors: BRAF-mu-\\ntant PDTCs primarily developed locoregional nodal metastases, \\nwhereas RAS-mutant PDTCs presented with distant metastases. \\nThe BRS tracked with the underlying driver mutation in PDTCs \\nbut not in ATCs. This was also true for a score derived from a gene \\nset consisting of mRNAs encoding proteins required for the dif-\\nferentiated function of thyrocytes (the TDS). The greater genomic \\ncomplexity of ATCs may account for blurring the association of \\ngene expression with the nature of the underlying driver muta-\\ntion, in particular because of the higher frequency of mutations \\nof genes encoding chromatin modifiers or genes that activate par-\\nallel pathways. Interestingly, even ATCs with RAS or other muta-\\ntions tend to be BRAF-like, as defined by the BRS. In addition, \\nATCs are extensively infiltrated by TAMs. Accordingly, nonhierar-\\nchical analysis of a gene set that defines M2 macrophages clearly \\nseparated ATCs from PDTCs. It may be that the greater cellular \\nheterogeneity of ATCs may account in part for the attenuation of \\nthe oncogenic driver effects on gene expression.\\nEIF1AX, which encodes for a key component of the translation \\npreinitiation complex (PIC), is mutated in only 1% of PTCs but \\nin approximately 10% of PDTCs and ATCs. The concordance of \\nEIF1AX with RAS mutations is extremely strong, which is distinct \\nfrom PTC, where these are largely mutually exclusive. The biolog-\\nical consequences of this association are currently unknown. The \\nmutations of EIF1AX cluster in specific N- and C-terminal resi-\\ndues. The C-terminal p.A113 splice mutation is specific to thyroid \\ncancer and predicts for alternative usage of a cryptic splice accep-\\ntor within exon 6, resulting in a 12–amino acid in-frame deletion. \\nOur analysis of RNASeq data from two cases with this mutation in \\nthe PTC TCGA confirms this prediction (not shown). EIF1A plays a \\nkey role in regulating the conformation of the PIC and in scanning \\nfor the AUG initiation codon, which is disrupted in distinct ways \\nby N-terminal and C-terminal mutations in yeast (44). Interest-\\ningly, EIF1AX mutations are mutually exclusive with alterations in \\nany of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway members, suggesting that \\nthey may confer overlapping functional gains. In addition, EIF1AX \\nmutations are predictive of worse survival in PDTCs, providing a \\npotentially useful marker for risk stratification in a heterogeneous \\ndisease in need of better prognostic indicators (45, 46).\\nBoth entities differed in overall mutation burden, which was sig-\\nnificantly higher in ATCs. Within PDTCs, a higher number of muta-\\ntions was associated with larger tumors, presence of metastasis, and \\nshorter survival. TP53 mutations, in particular, distinguished ATCs \\nfrom PDTCs (73% vs. 8%, respectively). CNAs, some of which had \\nbeen previously reported at very low frequencies (47–51), proved to \\nbe distinctive of each tumor type. PDTCs have a greater frequency \\nof 1p losses, whereas 8p and 17p losses, as well as 20q gains, were \\nmore common in ATCs. Interestingly, 22q losses were strongly asso-\\nciated with RAS-mutant PDTCs. Loss of the 22q tumor suppressor \\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC4767360', 'name': 'Poorly-Differentiated and Anaplastic Thyroid Cancers (MSK, JCI 2016)', 'description': 'Targeted sequencing of 341 cancer genes from 117 patient-derived PDTCs and ATCs', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '26878173', 'citation': 'Landa et al.

In tumors lacking canonical drivers, we used an average of \\nall likely clonal events. We discarded likely subclonal events (e.g., \\nmutations with disproportionately low allelic frequencies com-\\npared with other somatic variants). We discarded tumor suppres-\\nsors (i.e., TP53, NF1) as purity estimators due to possible coexisting \\nloss-of-heterozygosity events. Chromosomal regions harboring the \\ndrivers (typically BRAF or RAS) were confirmed to be diploid before \\nusing those genes as purity estimators. Altogether, we derived \\ntumor purity data from 75 BRAF/RAS-mutated tumors and used \\nalternative genes for 19 others. Purity could not be estimated with \\nconfidence for 23 tumors (22 PDTCs and 1 ATC).\\nSegmented genome-wide copy number was corrected for tumor \\npurity in the following manner. For all segments where r is the log2 ratio \\nof segmented copy number, then R = 2r and α is the estimated tumor \\npurity, the copy ratio in cancer cells of a cellularly heterogeneous sam-\\nple is therefore: R′ = (R/a) − ([1 – a]/a) for all r > log2(1 − a), otherwise \\nR′ = (r/min[r]) min (R′).\\nThe final purity-corrected copy number is log2(R’) for all segments \\nin the specimen. CNAs were determined using the purity-corrected \\nsegmented data utilizing one of two thresholds (±0.1 and the more \\nconservative ±0.4 threshold). All analyses were expressed at ±0.4, \\nwith the exception of survival analyses. As focal events were few, the \\nanalyses described here focused on larger and overt arm-level CNAs. \\nGiven the challenge of definitively establishing thresholds of hete-\\nrozygous loss and homozygous deletions in impure tumors (signal \\ncompression), our analysis excluded homozygous CNAs. CNAs were \\nvisualized in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), version 2.3.57 \\n(https:/\\n/www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) (60).\\nGene expression. We performed mRNA expression on 37 tumors \\nusing the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 array. Expression normalization \\nwas performed using the gcRMA method (61). Statistical analyses were \\nperformed using the R statistical programming language (62). The lists \\nof genes for the BRS and TDS scores were obtained from the TCGA \\nstudy on PTC (1). Of the 71 BRS genes, 67 were present on our array and \\nwere used to compute the BRS score as described (1). We performed \\nsample-wise scaling on the gene-expression profiles of the 9 PTC \\ntumors, which were derived from a published study (39). The lists of \\ndifferentially expressed genes between M1 and M2 macrophages (35) \\nwere from the MSigDB (63). The data discussed in this publication have \\nbeen deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (64) and \\nare accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE76039.\\nClinical associations. Statistical analyses were performed using \\nSTATA/IC (version 12; StataCorp LP). Pathological characteristics \\nwere only available for resected ATCs. PDTCs had complete clinical \\nand pathological data. Survival was recorded as of April 2015. All asso-\\nciations reported in PDTCs remained significant when only consider-\\ning PDTCs based on the Turin criteria definition.\\nStatistics. Distribution of mutation frequencies in PDTCs versus \\nATCs was assessed by Fisher’s exact tests. Copy number distribu-\\ntion between multiple groups was evaluated with χ2 tests. Statistical \\nanalyses and graphic representations of mutation and CNA distribu-\\ntion were performed on GraphPad Prism 6.02 (GraphPad Software). \\nDemographic and clinico-pathologic characteristics were compared \\nusing Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and 2-tailed Student’s t \\ntest or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Survival anal-\\nyses were conducted with Cox proportional hazards models. Propor-\\ntionality assumptions were tested with Schoenfeld residuals and log-\\ning high mitotic activity (≥ 5 mitosis/10 HPF, ×400) and/or tumor \\nnecrosis, and showing follicular cell differentiation at the morpho-\\nlogical or immunohistochemical level (27). MSK-IMPACT targeted \\nsequencing was performed in all 117 tumors (84 PDTCs and 33 \\nATCs): 80 from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) \\nand 37 from fresh-frozen material. The 37 frozen tumors, 17 PDTCs \\nand 20 ATCs, were also expression profiled with Affymetrix U133 \\nplus 2.0 array and with the Agilent SurePrint G3 CGH 1x1M array-\\nCGH platform to validate copy number calls.\\nSingle nucleotide variant and indel calling and filtering. Single \\nnucleotide variants (SNVs) and short indels (<30 bp in length) were \\nautomatically annotated by the MSK-IMPACT pipeline, as previously \\ndescribed (24). Tumor samples without paired normals (11/117; 5 \\nATCs and 6 PDTCs) were compared against pooled normals. All vari-\\nants were annotated based on the information available in catalog of \\nsomatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC; http:/\\n/cancer.sanger.ac.uk/\\ncosmic), NCBI-dbSNP (http:/\\n/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp), and the \\n1,000 Genomes Project (http:/\\n/www.1000genomes.org/). Variants \\nhighlighted in this study were subsequently manually reviewed. For \\nthe 106 tumors with paired normals, all variants confirmed as somatic \\nwere reported, regardless of location and clonality. For tumors com-\\npared against pooled normals, MSK-IMPACT automatically called \\nSNVs with reported frequencies <1%. We manually reviewed the 11 \\ntumors fulfilling these criteria as follows: (i) keeping variants reported \\nin COSMIC; (ii) removing variants reported as polymorphic (with an \\nreference sequence code in dbSNP); and (iii) removing variants with \\nallele frequencies that were >10% of the allelic fraction of the driver \\nmutation in the same tumor.\\nMSK-IMPACT sequencing data is publicly available at the cBio-\\nPortal for Cancer Genomics (http:/\\n/www.cbioportal.org/). Mutation \\nplots were generated using the OncoPrinter (v1.0.1) and Mutation-\\nMapper (v1.0.1) tools, which are available at the cBioPortal (57, 58).\\nChromosomal rearrangements were called for genes whose \\nintrons were covered by MSK-IMPACT, which included most of the \\npreviously reported fusions in thyroid tumors (with the notable excep-\\ntions of NTRK1 and NTRK3).\\nCNAs and estimation of tumor purity. DNA CNAs were primar-\\nily called from IMPACT by comparing sequence reads of targeted \\nregions in tumors relative to a standard diploid normal sample, \\nas described (24). Although IMPACT targets a discrete number of \\nexons in each chromosome arm, it efficiently identified arm-level \\nchromosomal genetic gains and losses, as confirmed by a genome-\\nwide Agilent SurePrint G3 CGH 1x1M array-CGH platform in a sub-\\nset of 37 advanced thyroid tumors (Supplemental Figure 3), which \\nshowed excellent agreement in the copy number calls between the \\ntwo methodologies.\\nAs the macrophage infiltration of advanced thyroid tumors \\n(particularly ATCs) can impact the sensitivity of CNA detection, \\nwe corrected CNA values for each tumor based on tumor purity. \\nTumor purity was calculated based on the mutant allele frequencies \\nof clonal heterozygous somatic mutations in regions lacking overt \\nCNAs (see also Supplemental Figure 2). For tumors with a BRAF or \\nRAS mutation (heterozygous mutations considered clonal events) \\n(59), purity was calculated by doubling the frequency of the alter-\\nnate allele (e.g., in a tumor with a BRAFV600E mutation frequency \\nof 0.45, tumor purity was 90%). For tumors without BRAF or RAS \\nmutations, we used other gene mutation frequencies as purity esti-\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC4767360', 'name': 'Poorly-Differentiated and Anaplastic Thyroid Cancers (MSK, JCI 2016)', 'description': 'Targeted sequencing of 341 cancer genes from 117 patient-derived PDTCs and ATCs', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '26878173', 'citation': 'Landa et al.

CCND1 is a weak\\noncogene that requires the cooperation of other oncogenic events\\nto transform lymphoid cells (2). Molecular studies have identiﬁed\\nalterations in components of the cell-cycle regulation, DNA\\ndamage response, and cell survival pathways (3, 4), but the proﬁle\\nof mutated genes contributing to the pathogenesis of MCL and\\ncooperating with CCND1 is not well deﬁned (1). Most MCL cases\\nhave a rapid evolution and an aggressive behavior with an un-\\nfavorable outcome with current therapies (5). Paradoxically,\\na subset of patients follows an indolent clinical evolution with\\nstable disease even in the absence of chemotherapy (6, 7). This\\nfavorable behavior has been associated with IGHV-mutated (8, 9)\\nand lack of expression of SOX11 (10, 11), a transcription factor\\nhighly speciﬁc of MCL that contributes to the aggressive behavior\\nof this tumor (12). However, the molecular mechanisms re-\\nsponsible for this clinical heterogeneity are not well understood.\\nTo gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MCL we\\nperformed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome\\nsequencing (WES) of 29 MCL and further investigated mutated\\ngenes in an expanded series of patients.

Selected\\nmutated genes were investigated in a validation series of 172\\nMCL patients (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S6). We detected about\\n3,700 somatic mutations per tumor (1.2 per Mb) by WGS (SI\\nAppendix, Figs. S1A and S2A and Dataset S1). The most com-\\nmon substitution was the transition C > T/G > A, usually oc-\\ncurring in a CpG context. Two IGHV-mutated MCL showed\\na higher proportion of A > C/T > G mutations than the two\\nIGHV-unmutated cases (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The break-\\npoints of the t(11;14) translocation differed in the four cases (13)\\n(SI Appendix, Table S7). We next investigated the presence of\\nregional clustering of somatic mutations by constructing “rainfall\\nplots” (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). Foci of hypermutation or kataegis,\\na phenomenon recently described in breast cancer (14), were\\nobserved in three cases. They were more frequent in the two\\nIGHV-mutated tumors. These clusters occurred around the\\n11q13 breakpoint of the t(11;14); the Ig genes at 2p11, 14q32.33,\\nand 22q11.22; and the deleted 9p21.3 region, but we also ob-\\nserved this phenomenon in regions without apparent structural\\nalterations and lacking coding genes (SI Appendix, Table S8).\\nThe same clusters of hypermutation were observed in the se-\\nquential sample of case M003, suggesting that kataegis in MCL\\nmay occur as an early phenomenon that remains stable during\\nthe evolution of the disease.\\nWe further characterized the spectrum of mutations in 29\\nMCL by WES (SI Appendix, Tables S1, S3, and S9 and Dataset\\nS2). All these cases were also analyzed by SNP array for copy\\nnumber alterations (CNA) and copy number neutral loss of\\nheterozygosity (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Table S10). We iden-\\ntiﬁed 652 protein-coding genes with somatic mutations affecting\\nthe structure of the encoded protein (nonsynonymous changes,\\nframeshifts in the coding sequence, and mutations affecting ca-\\nnonical splicing sites) with a median of 20 mutations per case\\n(range 8–47). Twenty-ﬁve of the 33 mutated genes in at least two\\nsamples were mutated at a rate signiﬁcantly higher than expected\\nby chance, and all tumors harbored mutations in at least 1 of\\nthese 25 genes (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S11). Similarly, ﬁve\\nof the six MCL cell lines also had mutations in at least one of the\\nrecurrently mutated genes identiﬁed in primary tumors (Fig. 1,\\nSI Appendix, and Dataset S3). Chromosomal CNAs were present\\nin 26/29 (90%) cases (mean 11.1 ± 9.2 per altered case) (SI\\nAppendix, Fig. S3 and Table S10). Tumors expressing SOX11\\nshowed a signiﬁcantly higher number of CNAs than SOX11-\\nnegative MCLs (mean 13 ± 9 versus 2 ± 2; P = 2.1 × 10−5),\\ndespite the similar number of somatic mutations (mean 24 ± 12\\nversus 17 ± 9; P = 0.141) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, ﬁve patients who\\ndid not need treatment (median 55 mo, range 4–147) had sig-\\nniﬁcantly fewer somatic protein-coding mutations (mean 11 ± 4\\nversus 25 ± 11, P = 3.4 × 10−5) and CNAs (mean 2 ± 3 versus\\n12 ± 9; P = 0.001) than patients who required treatment at di-\\nagnosis (n = 24).\\nRecurrent Somatic Mutations in MCL. ATM, CCND1, and TP53,\\npreviously described as drivers in MCL, were among the most\\nfrequently mutated genes in this study. ATM mutations were\\nfound in 12 of the 22 (55%) tumors expressing SOX11, but in\\nnone of the SOX11-negative MCL (P = 0.023) (Table 1, Fig. 1,\\nand SI Appendix, Table S9). Six of the mutations were associated\\nwith deletions of the wild-type allele, whereas ﬁve cases with no\\n11q loss had two different ATM mutations per case and only one\\nwas a single mutation with no 11q deletion (SI Appendix, Fig.\\nS4A). These mutations mainly truncated or affected functional\\ndomains (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). CCND1 mutations were found\\npredominantly in exon 1 (9 of 10 CCND1-mutated cases) (SI\\nAppendix, Fig. S6) and were more frequent in SOX11-negative\\nMCL [6/7 (86%) versus 4/22 (18%); P = 0.03] and with IGHV-\\nmutated [7/12 (58%) versus 3/16 (19%), P = 0.05], suggesting\\ntheir acquisition in the germinal center microenvironment\\n(Fig. 1, Table 1, and SI Appendix, Table S9). TP53 mutations [8/\\n29 (28%)] were associated with 17p alterations in six cases, and\\nonly one case without 17p alteration had two mutations. TP53\\nmutations were equally distributed in tumors regardless of\\nSOX11 expression or IGHV mutations (Fig. 1).\\nWe also identiﬁed recurrent mutations in WHSC1, MLL2,\\nBIRC3, MEF2B, and TLR2 (Table 1; Fig. 1), as well as NOTCH2\\nin one case. WHSC1 encodes a histone 3 methyltransferase of\\nlysine-36 (H3K36) that has not been found previously mutated in\\nlymphomas. Two missense mutations (p.E1099K and p.T1150A)\\nwere recurrently found in two cases each. Both residues are in\\nclose proximity and affect two of the most conserved domains in\\nexons 18 and 19. We further analyzed these exons in 101 addi-\\ntional tumors and conﬁrmed the presence of the same mutations\\nin nine more cases [total 13/130 (10%)] (Table 1, Fig. 2A, and SI\\nAppendix, Table S9 and Fig. S7). Interestingly, WHSC1 (also\\nnamed MMSET or NSD2) is the target of the IGH-translocation\\nt(4;14) in plasma cell myeloma (PCM), where it is overexpressed\\nand associated with an increase in H3K36 and a decrease in\\nH3K27 methylation across the genome (15). Gene expression\\nanalysis of 8 WHSC1-mutated and 31 WHSC1-unmutated MCL\\nidentiﬁed 236 genes differentially expressed (false discovery rate\\n<5%) with the majority of these genes [192/236 (81%)] up-reg-\\nulated in the WHSC1-mutated cases (Fig. 3B; SI Appendix, Table\\nS12). A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using previously\\npublished lymphoid gene expression signatures (15) demonstrated\\nthat WHSC1-mutated cases displayed signiﬁcant overexpression\\nof several signatures related to proliferation and cell-cycle regula-\\ntion (SI Appendix, Fig. S8) (16). Interestingly, WHSC1-mutated\\nMCL showed a highly signiﬁcant overexpression of the gene signa-\\nture up-regulated in PCM with the t(4;14) translocation over-\\nexpressing WHSC1 (17). In addition, WHSC1-mutated MCL\\nshowed overexpression of genes up-regulated by wild-type WHSC1\\nor the gain-of-function exon 19 mutant WHSC1 in the KMS11\\nPCM cell line (15) (SI Appendix, Fig. S8).\\nIn addition, the histone methyltransferase MLL2 was mutated\\nin 4/29 primary tumors and 2/6 MCL cell lines. Four of the six\\nmutations were truncating and two were missense changes and\\naffected the conserved FYRN and FYRC domains (Table 1 and\\nSI Appendix, Fig. S9). None of these cases had a deletion of the\\nFig. 1.\\nWES in 29 cases and 6 MCL cell lines.

MEF2B carried the same p.K23R somatic muta-\\ntion in exon 2 in 2/29 primary tumors, and a p.N49S mutation in\\nexon 2 was found in the REC-1 cell line. We then expanded the\\nstudy of exon 2 in 158 MCL cases and found the same p.K23R\\nmutation in four additional tumors [total 6/187 (3.2%)] (Table 1\\nand SI Appendix, Figs.

In\\naddition to ATM, BIRC3 is also located in this region (11q22.2).\\nWe found inactivating mutations in exon 9 in two MCL cases and\\na splice-site mutation in an additional patient (Table 1, Fig. 1,\\nand Fig. 3C). We expanded the study and found mutations in 11/\\n173 (6.4%) cases, and these cases had more frequent 11q dele-\\ntions than BIRC3-unmutated MCL [10/11 (91%) versus 25/87\\n(29%), respectively; P = 1.1 × 10−4] (Fig. 2D).\\nWe found two mutations of TLR2 in two SOX11-negative/\\nIGHV-mutated MCL (Table 1). One of these mutations (p.D327V)\\nhad been previously identiﬁed in one IGHV-mutated chronic\\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (18). To determine the potential\\nfunctional activity of these mutations, we stimulated primary cells\\nof the two TLR2-mutated MCL cases (M021, M003), the mutated\\nCLL case, and 11 unmutated controls (3 CLL, 4 MCL, and 4\\nnormal B-cell samples) with TLR2 agonists and assessed the\\nresponse of 25 cytokines. CLL and MCL cells carrying the p.\\nD327V mutation showed a signiﬁcant increased secretion of IL-\\n1RA and IL-6 and, to a lesser extent, of IL-8 compared with\\nTLR2-unmutated samples (Fig. 2E and SI Appendix, Fig. S11).\\nThe MCL carrying the p.Y298S mutation had extremely high\\nbasal levels of IL-6 compared with the basal or poststimulation\\nlevels of other tumors or normal B lymphocytes (Fig. 2F). Sev-\\neral TLR2 agonist stimuli (PGN-SA, LTA-SA, or PAM3) did not\\ngenerate additional IL-6 increases in these cells.\\nAmong the other mutated genes, we found mutations of the\\nubiquitin ligase UBR5, recently described in MCL patients (19),\\nand an inactivating mutation affecting B2M (p.L13fs*10) in a\\nMCL carrying a 15q12–q21.1 deletion, encompassing the B2M\\nlocus. However, we did not ﬁnd mutations in an additional 97\\nMCL patients, including 3 with a similar 15q monoallelic deletion.\\nNOTCH2 and NOTCH1 Mutations in MCL. The ﬁnding of a NOTCH2\\nmutation prompted us to expand the analysis of the HD, TAD,\\nand PEST domains in additional tumors, and we found muta-\\ntions in 9/172 MCL (5.2%) (Table 1; Fig. 3A). All these muta-\\ntions generate a premature stop codon within the PEST do-\\nmain. Gene expression analysis of two NOTCH2-mutated and\\n19 NOTCH2-unmutated MCL (also wild-type for NOTCH1)\\nshowed many differentially expressed genes (n = 841) (false\\ndiscovery rate < 5%); 42% of them (n = 355) were up-regu-\\nlated in NOTCH2-mutated cases and were signiﬁcantly enriched\\nin cell-cycle and metabolic pathways (Fig. 3B, SI Appendix, and\\nDataset S4). GSEA showed that NOTCH2 mutated samples\\ndisplayed a signiﬁcant overexpression of genes up-regulated by\\nNOTCH activation in lymphoid cells (20) and also had a con-\\ncordant modulation of gene signatures regulated by NOTCH\\ninhibition in MCL cell lines (21–23) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12).\\nNOTCH2 mutations occurred more frequently in blastoid/pleo-\\nmorphic MCL (66 versus 18%, P = 0.001) and conferred a dis-\\nmal prognosis [3-y overall survival (OS): 0 versus 62%, P = 2.5 ×\\n10−4] (Fig. 3C).

We investigated this gene and found truncating mutations\\nin 8/172 (4.6%) MCL cases, as well as in MINO and REC-1 cells\\n(Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S14).

"), Document(page_content='Analysis\\nof the frequency of reads supporting somatic substitution allowed\\nthe estimation of major subclonal populations (24). Four of the\\nsix patients with simultaneous samples showed the same muta-\\ntions and CNAs in the peripheral blood (PB) sample and cor-\\nresponding lymphoid tissue, suggesting the presence of a single\\nmajor clone at both sites. In contrast, two cases (M023 and\\nM026) had a subset of common mutations in both topographic\\nsites, but they also carried a subset of mutated genes that were\\nexclusive of the PB or tissue tumor sample (Fig. 4 A and B). This\\npattern of alterations is consistent with two major subpopu-\\nlations derived from an initial founder clone differentially rep-\\nresented in the two topographic sites. In addition, we also observed\\na different pattern of genomic alterations at diagnosis and pro-\\ngression in the two cases with sequential samples (Fig. 4C and D\\nand SI Appendix, Table S10). Patient M003 had stable disease\\nwithout treatment for more than 3 y and then rapidly progressed.\\nThe major clone identiﬁed at diagnosis gained new mutations\\nand genomic complexity at the time of clinical progression. This\\nnew clone carried the same 17p deletion and somatic mutations\\nobserved in the initial sample, but had a 16% increase in the\\nnumber of whole-genome mutations (from 3,928 to 4,665) (SI\\nAppendix, Fig. S1A). These included nonsynonymous mutations\\nin additional genes, a complex DNA copy number proﬁle with 20\\nacquired CNAs, and chromothripsis involving chromosomes 4\\nand 12 (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Patient M002 was\\ntreated with chemotherapy after diagnosis and relapsed 3 y later.\\nThe major clone at relapse maintained a subset of CNAs and\\nsomatic mutations present at diagnosis, but 11 of the initial\\nmutations had disappeared and other mutated genes had\\nemerged (Fig. 4D). This pattern of evolution is consistent with\\nthe eradication of the major initial subclone by chemotherapy\\nand the relapse of a new subclone after treatment.\\nComparison of the allele frequency of mutations in the dif-\\nferent simultaneous or evolving subclones may help to infer the\\ndynamic architecture of somatic events in the evolution of\\ntumors (24, 25). Eight of the 25 recurrently mutated genes in\\nMCL (ATM, CCND1, MLL2, KCNC2, KIAA1671, PCSK2,\\nTNRC6B, and TRPM6) were present at similar allelic frequency\\nin the two subclones of different cases, suggesting that they\\nrepresent early events. In contrast, four recurrently mutated\\ngenes (ABCA3, TLR2, TP53, and WHSC1) were seen in only one\\nof the two simultaneous or emerging subclones at progression,\\nsupporting the notion that they might constitute later events. We\\nfurther analyzed by Sanger sequencing 11 additional serial and 8\\nsimultaneous tumor samples from different topographic sites\\n(PB and lymphoid tissues) (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). Interestingly,\\nwe observed that BIRC3 mutations were absent at diagnosis in\\ntwo cases that acquired the mutation in a posttreatment sample\\nassociated with the acquisition of an 11q22.1–q24.2 deletion in\\none of them. Another case showed the BIRC3 mutation in the PB\\nbut not in the simultaneous lymph node. Additionally, NOTCH1\\nwas mutated in only one of the synchronic samples in two cases.\\n'), Document(page_content="Discussion\\nWe have conducted a comprehensive genomic study of MCL\\nthat has revealed the heterogeneous spectrum of somatic mu-\\ntations of this tumor, with several molecular mechanisms con-\\ntributing to the pathogenesis and the clinical progression of the\\ndisease. The genome sequencing of simultaneous and sequential\\ntumor samples has highlighted the subclonal heterogeneity of the\\nmutations already present at diagnosis and their dynamic evo-\\nlution in the progression of the disease.\\nThe whole-genome analysis showed a relative low number of\\nglobal somatic mutations in MCL (1.2 per Mb), slightly higher to\\nCLL (26) or acute myeloid leukemia (27), but lower than in other\\nlymphoid or nonhematopoietic tumors (28, 29). Interestingly, we\\nidentiﬁed a distinct mutational signature characterized by A > C/\\nT > G substitutions in a TpA context in the two MCL with\\nIGHV-mutated. This signature was initially identiﬁed in CLL\\nwith IGHV-mutated and more recently conﬁrmed as a unique\\nfeature of lymphoid neoplasms originating in germinal center\\ncells (26, 29) and has been attributed to the action of the error-\\nprone DNA polymerase η during the IGHV somatic hyper-\\nmutation process (26).\\nThe most commonly mutated genes were the previously\\nidentiﬁed MCL drivers ATM, CCND1, and TP53. These muta-\\ntions were differentially distributed in subtypes of the disease\\naccording to the IGHV mutational status and SOX11 expression.\\nThus, ATM mutations were seen only in SOX11-positive tumors,\\nwhereas CCND1 mutations were preferentially detected in\\nMCL with IGHV-mutated and TP53 mutations were equally\\nFig. 3.\\nNOTCH2 alterations in mantle cell lymphoma.

The integration of the\\nCNA and somatic mutations showed that only TP53, ATM, and\\nBIRC3 recurrent mutations were associated with allelic losses\\n(17p and 11q, respectively), whereas CDKN2A, the only gene\\ntargeted by recurrent homozygous deletions, did not carry so-\\nmatic mutations in other cases. Interestingly, three mutated\\ngenes (WHSC1, MLL2, and MEF2B) function as chromatin\\nmodiﬁers, and altogether these mutations occurred in 10 of the\\n29 (14%) cases examined by WES. The analysis of WHSC1 and\\nMEF2B in an expanded series conﬁrmed the relative high fre-\\nquency of these mutations in MCL (10% and 3.2%, respec-\\ntively). WHSC1 mutations have not been described previously\\nin lymphomas, but this gene is the target of the t(4;14) trans-\\nlocation in PCM, and the same mutation observed in exon 18 has\\nbeen recently detected in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia\\n(ALL) patient (30). The WHSC1 overexpression in PCM and the\\nmutation in ALL seem to have an activating function because\\nthey increase the H3K36 methylation associated with a methylation\\ndecrease in H3K27 across the genome (15). Our WHSC1-mutated\\nprimary MCL had the same overexpressed gene signatures\\nmodulated by WHSC1 activation in PCM, suggesting that these\\nmutations may also have a similar activating function in MCL.\\nThe mutations observed in MLL2 and MEF2B are similar to\\nthose detected in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and\\nfollicular lymphomas, but their functional consequences are not\\nyet well understood (31–33). Notably, virtually all MLL2, WHSC1,\\nand MEF2B mutations were found in MCL with IGHV-unmutated\\nor expressing SOX11.\\nRecent studies have suggested a role of microenvironment\\nstimuli in sustaining MCL (1). TLRs mediate cell responses to\\nspeciﬁc pathogen-associated molecular patterns (34). In that\\nsense, we found mutations of TLR2 in two SOX11-negative/\\nIGHV-mutated MCL, and these mutations were associated with\\nincreased production of IL-1RA and IL-6 by the tumor cells.\\nNotably, high levels of IL-1RA have been associated with ag-\\ngressive behavior in some lymphomas (35), and IL-6 sustains\\ngrowth and survival of MCL cells (36). These ﬁndings suggest\\nthat TLR2 mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of\\na subset of SOX11-negative/IGHV-mutated MCL by modulating\\ntumor microenvironment responses.\\nIn addition to the statistically signiﬁcant mutations described\\nabove, we found a mutation in NOTCH2 in one MCL. Similar\\nactivating mutations have been recently described in splenic\\nmarginal zone lymphomas and in NOTCH1 in aggressive CLL\\nand MCL (37, 38). These ﬁndings prompted us to expand the\\nstudy of NOTCH2 and NOTCH1 mutations in MCL and found\\ntheir presence in 5.2% and 4.7% of the tumors, respectively. All\\nthese mutations generated truncating and likely more active\\nproteins and occurred in a subset of tumors with very aggressive\\nclinical behavior. Only 1 of 16 tumors had simultaneous muta-\\ntions in both genes, suggesting that they may give a similar se-\\nlective advantage to the cells. All these ﬁndings indicate that\\nNOTCH1/2 mutations in MCL activate this pathway and are\\na frequent mechanism involved in the aggressive behavior of\\nthe tumors.\\nThe spectrum of mutations described in this work highlights\\nthe existence of common molecular features as well as relevant\\ndifferences in the genetic alterations present in different sub-\\ntypes of lymphoid neoplasms. Thus, NOTCH1 mutations have\\nbeen found in CLL (18, 26) whereas NOTCH2 is mutated in\\nsplenic marginal zone lymphomas (37, 38); however, none of\\nthese tumors carry mutations in both NOTCH genes as observed\\nin MCL. In addition, MLL2 and MEF2B mutations are shared\\nwith DLBCL (31–33) but are uncommon in CLL, whereas MCL\\nhas frequent mutations of ATM and BIRC3 that are also fre-\\nquent in CLL (39) but uncommon in DLBCL. In contrast,\\nWHSC1 mutations appear to be speciﬁc for MCL while lacking\\nmutations in genes frequently mutated in other hematological\\nneoplasias (e.g., MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, SF3B1).\\nRecent genomic studies have revealed the complex subclonal\\nheterogeneity of different tumors and its dynamic evolution in\\nthe course of the disease (40). The sequence of two simultaneous\\nor longitudinal samples in different topographic sites in our study\\nhas revealed that some tumors may have at least two major\\nsubclones already at diagnosis with different representation in\\ntwo topographic sites, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. In\\naddition, the evolution of the tumors is also heterogeneous with\\nthe eradication of some clones by the chemotherapy treatment\\nand the emergency of other new clones at the progression of the\\ndisease or at relapse after chemotherapy.

However, most studies have used whole-\\nexome sequencing (WES) to quantify TMB, a methodology that is\\nnot currently feasible or expedient at the scale of a clinical setting. By\\ncontrast, genomic proﬁling of tumors by using targeted next-\\ngeneration sequencing (NGS) is increasingly routine. At Memorial\\nSloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), a custom hybridization\\ncapture-based NGS assay (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated\\nMutation Proﬁling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT])14\\nhas been used to analyze . 10,000 tumors.15\\nWe hypothesized that TMB determined by targeted NGS may\\nassociate with response to immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC.\\nTo address this hypothesis, we examined 240 patients with NSCLC\\nproﬁled by targeted NGS and who were treated with anti–PD-1 or\\nanti–PD-L1 [anti–PD-(L)1]–based therapy. A subset of tumors from\\nthese patients also were analyzed by WES to examine the correlation of\\nTMB derived by both methods. Secondary analyses included an\\nexamination of associations of other molecular features obtained from\\ntargeted NGS, such as copy number alterations and speciﬁc genes,\\nwith response or resistance to ICIs as well as the relationship between\\nTMB and PD-L1 expression.\\nMETHODS\\nPatients\\nAfter MSKCC institutional review board approval, patients with ad-\\nvanced NSCLC treated with anti–PD-(L)1 monotherapy or in combination\\nwith anti–cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 (anti–CTLA-4) between April 2011\\n(the ﬁrst date on which a patient with NSCLC was treated with ICI at our\\ncenter) and January 2017 (the last date to have begun therapy to permit\\nenough time for at least one response assessment before database lock in May\\n2017) were identiﬁed. Patients with tumors molecularly proﬁled by MSK-\\nIMPACT were included. A prespeciﬁed sample size was not determined.\\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 was used\\nto assess efﬁcacy; scans were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist (D.H., A.P., or\\nN.L.) prospectively in patients treated as part of clinical trials or retro-\\nspectively in patients treated outside a clinical trial (Appendix Fig A1, online\\nonly). Patients who were not evaluable radiologically were excluded.\\nProgression-free survival (PFS) was assessed from the date the patient began\\nimmunotherapy to the date of progression. Patients who had not progressed\\nwere censored at the date of their last scan; cases retrospectively adjudicated\\nto not be progressive disease (PD) per RECIST but determined in real-time\\nby the treating clinician as PD were considered as events. In addition to\\nresponse deﬁned by RECIST, efﬁcacy also was deﬁned as durable clinical\\nbeneﬁt (DCB; complete response [CR]/partial response [PR] or stable disease\\n[SD] that lasted . 6 months) or no durable beneﬁt (NDB, PD or SD that\\nlasted # 6 months12; Appendix Fig A2, online only). Patients who had not\\nprogressed and were censored before 6 months of follow-up were considered\\nnot evaluable. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from treatment start date.\\nPatients who did not die were censored at the date of last contact.\\nTo provide a comparison cohort, patients with NSCLC who had\\nundergone MSK-IMPACT testing between January 2014 and March 2017\\nand were not treated with any immunotherapy (non-ICI NSCLC; n = 1,836)\\nwere identiﬁed. For comparisons speciﬁcally related to OS, which was\\ncalculated from the date of recurrent or metastatic disease, a subset of these\\npatients with non-ICI NSCLC with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma\\n(non-ICI advanced stage; n = 60816) were used (Appendix Fig A1).\\nMSK-IMPACT Sequencing\\nThe MSK-IMPACT assay was performed as previously described.14\\nBrieﬂy, DNA was extracted from tumors and patient-matched blood\\nsamples. Bar-coded libraries were generated and sequenced and targeted all\\nexons and select introns of a custom gene panel of 341 (56 patients; version\\n1), 410 (164 patients; version 2), or 468 (20 patients, version 3) genes\\n(Appendix Table A1, online only). Mean sequencing coverage across all\\ntumor samples was 7443, with minimum depth of coverage of 913.\\nSamples were run through a custom pipeline14 to identify somatic al-\\nterations, including mutations and copy number alterations. Data are\\navailable through the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.17 To normalize\\nsomatic nonsynonymous TMB across panels of various sizes, the total\\nnumber of mutations was divided by the coding region captured in each\\npanel, which covered 0.98, 1.06, and 1.22 megabases (Mb) in the 341-, 410-,\\nand 468-gene panels, respectively (Appendix Fig A3, online only). The\\nfraction of copy number–altered genome (FGA) was deﬁned as the fraction\\nof genome with log2 copy number gain . 0.2 or loss , 20.2 relative to the\\nsize of the genome with copy number proﬁled.

Of these, 240 (60% of those molecularly proﬁled, 32% of\\nall patients treated) were radiologically evaluable for response and\\nare included in this analysis. Demographic features of the current\\npatient cohort (Table 1) are similar to the overall group of patients\\ntreated with anti–PD-(L)1 therapy (Appendix Table A4, online\\nonly). Forty-nine patients (20%) had CR/PR; 69 (29%) had DCB.\\nThe median TMB was 7.4 SNVs/Mb (range, 0.8 to 91.8 SNVs/Mb).\\nTo determine whether targeted NGS could accurately quan-\\ntitate TMB in NSCLC, we compared TMB quantiﬁed by MSK-\\nIMPACTand WES in a subset of patients. In patients proﬁled with\\nboth targeted NGS and WES (n = 49), TMB assessed by targeted\\nNGS was highly correlated with TMB assessed by WES (Spearman\\nr = 0.86; P , .001; Fig 1A). By using data from targeted NGS, TMB\\nwas greater in patients with DCB than with NDB (median, 8.5 v 6.6\\nSNVs/Mb; P = .0062) and in patients with CR/PR versus SD versus\\nPD (median, 8.5 v 6.6 v 6.6 SNVs/Mb; P = .0151; Fig 1B).\\nWe examined how increasing cut points of TMB affected rates of\\nDCB and PFS to ICI treatment. When TMB was stratiﬁed into in-\\ncreasing quartiles, rates of DCB and PFS improved with increasing\\nTMB (Figs 1C and 1D); improved DCB rate and PFSwere seen in those\\nwith TMB above versus below the 50th percentile (DCB rate, 38.6% v\\n25.1%; P = .009 [Appendix Fig A4, online only]; PFS HR, 1.38; P =\\n.024 [Appendix Fig A5, online only]). The rate of DCB and PFS were\\nalso improved among those in the top decile of TMB in the cohort\\n(Figs 1C and 1D). By contrast, survival outcomes among patients with\\nadvanced NSCLC not treated with immunotherapy16 did not correlate\\nwith increasing TMB; in fact, an inverse relationship between TMB and\\nsurvival was identiﬁed (Appendix Fig A6, online only).\\nIn addition, FGA was lowest in patients with DCB and sig-\\nniﬁcantly higher in those with NDB than in those with non-ICI\\nNSCLC (median, 0.16 v 0.11; P = .007; Fig 1E). Of note, despite\\na negative association with response to ICIs, FGA had a modest but\\nsigniﬁcantly positive association with TMB (Appendix Fig A7,\\nonline only).\\nGene Alterations Associated With Response and\\nResistance to Immunotherapy\\nWe next assessed whether mutations in individual genes were\\nassociated with response or resistance to ICI treatment. First, we\\nexamined the frequency of common oncogenic driver mutations\\nfound in NSCLC and their association with clinical beneﬁt from\\nICI treatment.24 Mutations in KRAS were common (n = 83), and\\nthe rate of DCB was similar in this group compared with the overall\\nstudy cohort (36%; Fig 2). Those with EGFR mutations rarely\\nexperienced DCB (7%) and were signiﬁcantly underrepresented in\\nthe DCB group compared with the non-ICI NSCLC group (FDR-\\nadjusted P = .013 Appendix Fig A8, online only). STK11 was\\nsigniﬁcantly enriched in the NDB group compared with the non-\\nICI NSCLC group (FDR-adjusted P = .007).\\nWe also examined the prevalence and impact of alterations in\\ngenes associated with antigen presentation on response to im-\\nmunotherapy (Fig 2; Appendix Fig A9, online only). Truncating\\nmutations in the gene encoding B2M and deleterious mutations in\\nJAK1 and JAK2 have recently been identiﬁed as mechanisms that\\nlead to primary and acquired resistance to anti–PD-1 treatment in\\nTable 1.

Considered as continuous variables, PD-L1 and TMB\\nhad a similar predictive impact on the likelihood of DCB (TMB\\nAUC, 0.601; PD-L1 AUC, 0.646; Fig 3C). When considered as\\na composite variable, patients with high TMB (greater than the\\ngroup median) and PD-L1 positivity ($ 1% expression) had a 50%\\nrate of DCB, whereas the presence of only one or neither variable\\nwas associated with a lower rate of DCB (Fig 3D).

Because there was no\\npositive correlation between increasing TMB and survival in\\na cohort of patients not treated with ICIs, we demonstrate that the\\neffect of TMB is predictive rather than prognostic. In fact, survival\\namong patients with high TMB is worse in the absence of ICI,\\nwhich also highlights the clinical value of ICI to improve survival\\nand overcome naturally poor prognostic features.\\nAlthough TMB has been a major focus of biomarker studies,\\nother molecular features also have been hypothesized to inﬂuence\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n200\\n400\\n600\\n800\\n1,000\\n1,200\\nMutations by WES\\nMutations/Mb by Targeted NGS\\nA\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nP = .006\\nP = .049\\nP < .001\\nDCB\\n(n = 69)\\nNDB\\n(n = 158)\\nCR/PR\\n(n = 49)\\nSD\\n(n = 83)\\nPD\\n(n = 108)\\nNon-ICI NSCLC\\n(n = 1,836)\\nMutations/Mb\\nB\\n0\\nFig 1.

Aneuploidy was shown\\nrecently to reduce response to immunotherapy in patients with\\nmelanoma.29,30 These reports largely focused on patients treated\\nwith CTLA-4 therapy and hypothesized that aneuploidy negatively\\ncorrelates with the presence of cytotoxic immune inﬁltrates that\\nmay subsequently lead to poor survival outcomes in these patients.\\nSimilarly, we found that the FGA was highest among patients who\\nderived the least beneﬁt from ICIs. Despite this inverse association,\\nFGA and TMB were modestly but positively associated with each\\nother, consistent with a previous report.29 Given the growing\\nconcordance of data that support aneuploidy and lack of response\\nto ICIs, additional work is needed to explore the underlying\\nmechanism and impact of its interaction with TMB.\\nBeyond summary metrics, such as TMB and FGA, we also\\nexamined the impact of speciﬁc gene alterations on beneﬁt from\\nICI. In an unbiased analysis, few additional genes were signiﬁcantly\\nassociated with DCB and NDB. Mutations in EGFR were un-\\nderrepresented among patients with DCB, which is likely related to\\nthe association of EGFR mutations with never smokers31 and\\nresulting low TMB. Other actionable mutations in lung cancer also\\nwere found in low frequency in the current data set (Table 1). Future\\nanalysis is needed to clarify the activity of immunotherapy and\\nwhether TMB is similarly relevant in these patients. Alterations in\\nSTK11 also were associated with lack of beneﬁt, which is consistent\\nwith recent reports that described low tumor inﬂammation in\\nmurine models and human tumors with STK11 alterations.32,33\\nWe also explored speciﬁc alterations that have been previously\\npurported to affect response to ICI. For example, ampliﬁcations in\\nMDM2 and MDM4 have been associated with hyperprogression,27\\nalthough this was not seen in the current cohort.

Durable clinical beneﬁt (DCB)/no durable beneﬁt (NDB) compared with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)–deﬁned beneﬁt. DCB and NDB are\\nclinically useful, simple, binary outcomes to categorize those who beneﬁt or not from immunotherapy. These groups have survival outcomes similar to RECIST-deﬁned\\ncomplete response (CR)/partial response (PR) or progressive disease (PD) while also incorporating meaningful distinction of those with stable disease (SD) who are\\nbeneﬁters or not. (A) Overall survival of patients with DCB/NDB or CR/PR, SD, or PD. Survival of DCB closely mirrors that of CR/PR, and NDB mirrors patients with PD. (B) A\\nfocus just on patients with SD shows a signiﬁcant difference in overall survival stratiﬁed by DCB and NDB (P , .001). RECIST-deﬁned SD, therefore, is an intermediate\\ngroup that is comprised by a “true” beneﬁt (progression-free survival [PFS] . 6 months) and not a “true” beneﬁt (PFS , 6 months). Therefore, dichotomizing outcomes by\\nduration of beneﬁt more explicitly captures the major contribution of beneﬁt from immunotherapy (durability), removes patients with uncommon short-lived responses, and\\nimproves adjudication of those with RECIST-deﬁned SD, a heterogeneous group that comprises true beneﬁt or not of immunotherapy.\\n© 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\\nJOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY\\nRizvi et al\\n', metadata={'pmc_id': 'PMC6075848', 'name': 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MSK, J Clin Oncol 2018)', 'description': 'IMPACT sequencing of 240 NSCLC tumor/normal pairs treated at MSKCC with anti-PD-(L)1 based therapy.', 'publicStudy': True, 'pmid': '29337640', 'citation': 'Rizvi et al.
