Moreover, TARGET data can be used for research relevant to the biology, causes, treatment and late complications of treatment of pediatric cancers, but is not intended for the sole purposes of methods and/or tool development (please see <a href=\"https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/using-target-data\">Using TARGET Data</a> section of the OCG website). If you are interested in using TARGET data for publication or other research purposes, you must follow the <a href=\"https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/target-publication-guidelines\">TARGET Publication Guidelines</a>.</p>",
